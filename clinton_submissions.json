            "selftext": "I want to start off by saying that I'm not against all forms of gun control. I think strengthening background checks, preventing guns from entering the hands of the mentally unstable, and closing the gun show loophole are all great ideas with no downside to society.\n\nHowever, if you support an all out ban on assault weapons, I can only assume it's for one of two reasons. One, you don't know the information surrounding current assault weapon regulation, statistics surrounding assault weapon usage, or the history of assault weapon bans in this county. Two, you know this information and choose to ignore the only logical conclusion in favor of an emotional and irrational response, making you intellectually dishonest.\n\nHere are the facts in questions that make an assault weapons ban illogical.\n\nOf the roughly 30k gun related deaths per year, 20k are suicide, leaving 10k that are homicide. In 2012 specifically, there were 11k homicides. Of that, only 322 people were killed with ANY kind of rifle, including assault rifles and hunting rifles. Handguns make up 80% of total gun crime, and shotguns bridge the gap. In fact, the total of handguns, shotguns, and rifles considered to have \"military features\" only accounted for 2% of total gun crime.\n\nAssault weapons bans have been passed before. One was passed under Clinton, and expired in the early 2000s. Gun crime fell... AFTER the ban expired, and analysis proved no correlation between the fall in crime and the ban.\n\nAmericans are wrong about gun crime rates as well. Gun crime has fallen 49% since 1993, and after sandy hook 56% of Americans wrongly believed that gun crime was higher now than it was 20 years ago. This is likely due to media focusing so heavily on mass shootings.\n\nAssault weapons are already strictly regulated. No fully automatic weapon designed after 1986 can be legally purchased in the U.S. and the few that are legal to purchase require the individual to go through much more extensive paperwork and fees, including having your local police force sign off on allowing you to own the weapon. They are also prohibitively expensive, with cheaper ones costing well over $15,000 a piece before fees. Semi automatic assault style weapons do not follow the same rules, but cannot have features that make them too similar or easily convertible to their fully automatic counterparts.\n\nA side issue is illegal trafficking. Most guns used in homicide crime, specifically mass shootings, are obtained illegally. In fact there is very little evidence suggesting a ban on any type of gun would have a meaningful impact on any type of gun crime because of how prevalent illegal gun trafficking is in inner city gang violence which makes up the large majority of gun homicides.\n\nA common argument made in favor of an assault ban is that people don't need them, and that's true. Strictly speaking, nobody NEEDS an assault style rifle. However, who gets to decide when something people want shouldn't be allowed to be had? What about cigarettes, alcohol, or even cars? Certainly nobody needs the first two, and if you were really dead set on saving lives you could argue that we could invest heavily in self driving cars and mandate they be used by everyone. All three of those things kill many many times more people a year than assault weapons. What about flu vaccines? More than 30,000 people die a year in the U.S. from the flu. You could save more lives by requiring people to get flu vaccines. There are just so many things that kill so many more people by such a large margin that we don't \"need\" that making that argument is very disingenuous.\n\nThe only way I could see someone in support of an assault weapons ban as being intellectually honest would be if they were in support of any government restriction on personal freedom that could save even a single life, because otherwise your stance isn't rational.\n\nI might even support an assault weapons ban if there was any evidence at all that they were an actual and real problem, and that the ban would have a real effect on the problem. As it stands, the absolute most that can possibly be said, assuming nobody kills anyone with a hunting or sport rifle, is that .0001% of the population is killed by assault rifles every year. There have to be hundreds of completely innocuous things that kill more people per year than assault rifles, things non of us would ever think about controlling through legislation. So why assault rifles? Because people are scared of them for no reason? Because people don't like the big bad gun lobby? I don't know. I'm sure most politicians in support of an assault weapons ban probably believe it's the right thing. If they do, frankly they're idiots. However, I wouldn't be surprised if quite a few of them recognize that an assault weapons ban is an easy way to take millions of dollars away from the gun lobby, weakening republicans, and I would be absolutely shocked if that wasn't at least one politicians primary motivation.\n\nMy last thing I would like people to consider before attempting to change my view is that guns aren't just abstract objects. They are real things made by people. How many people's jobs and livelihoods would are dependent on or would be impacted negatively by an assault weapons ban? Companies would lose a lot of business, people would lose jobs from those who manage the acquiring and selling of raw materials, to those in charge of the acquisition of those raw materials, to the people who make those materials into guns, to the people who distribute the guns to retailers and to the retailers themselves. Then count that plus all of the same people in the process for making bullets for those guns. Consider the economic impact that a ban like this could have on many thousand more people than are currently being harmed yearly by assault weapons.\n\nEDIT1: thank you so much everyone for your responses. I have not been able to respond to every comment I would like to, but will post another edit later when I can to address some of the more common points people are making and why I disagree with them.\n\nEDIT2: ok so I would like to address a few common points.\n\n1.) there's no need to own an assault weapon.\n\nNo, there isn't. As I've said, that's not a reason to not allow people to have them. I don't need fast cars, I don't need comfortable cars, I probably need some kind of car, but I don't need all of those features, so I shouldn't be able to have them? No, that makes no sense. A more direct comparison is alcohol. More people are killed by drunk driving in 15 days than are killed by any kind of rifle in a year. That doesn't even factor alcohol related homicides or overdoses. There is no need to have alcohol, nobody strictly speaking needs it just like nobody strictly speaking needs an assault weapon. We have decided as a country that we are ok with the consequences of having alcohol be legal because we value personal freedom and recognize that freedom comes with consequences. It's far more logical from a death toll standpoint to outlaw alcohol than it is to outlaw assault weapons. Actually, almost any ban on any product would make more sense than an assault weapons ban in terms of death toll.\n\n2.) assault weapons are different because they are designed to spread death quickly.\n\nThere are two issues with this. The less important though still significant one is I could easily put 500 guns in pairs in front of you, all with the exact same clip size, exact same bullet size, and exact same firing mechanism (semi automatic). 250 of them would not count as assault weapons under and assault weapons ban, and 250 of them would classify as assault weapons. The only difference is cosmetic appearance.\n\nThe second and more important issue is that what something is designed for has no relevance to what it is actually used for. Alcohol as a consistently good example. Alcohol is a drink designed to inebriated and be enjoyed. In no way shape or form is alcohol directly designed or made to cause violence and death. Yet, alcohol causes many many times the amount of of death that assault weapons do. I would even argue that since most assault weapons available to the public are stripped less lethal versions of their military counterparts, and that most of them AND their military counterparts are chambered in a NATO 5.56 round, which is a small bullet designed to be LESS deadly and more penetrative/accurate, one could argue that assault weapons are not necessarily even designed to rapidly kill people. Still, even if you accept that they are designed to kill people, it's doesn't matter because that's not what they are actually being used for by civilians. There are millions of legally owned assault weapons and a tiny handful are ever used to do harm. I wouldn't be surprised if there wasn't a single case of a legally owned full blown assault rifle (selective/automatic fire actual military model weapons regulated by the 1986 law) being used in a homicide because of how difficult and expensive they are to get.\n\nSo you have something designed for personal enjoyment, and something \"designed to kill people,\" but the thing designed for enjoyment results in many many times more deaths than the thing \"designed to kill.\" Before anyone says alcohol deaths only affect the user so it's different, say that to the sober people killed by drunk drivers or victims of alcohol related homicide.\n\n3.) Europeans have strict gun laws and they have low crime rates.\n\nFirst off, my stance is not anti any gun law, my stance is specifically anti assault weapons bans, and by extension anti weapons bans. Many Europeans countries have stricter laws than we do, but even the strictest do not have all out bans. In fact, many European countries have some of the highest rates of civilian gun ownership in the world. The top 20 gun owning countries include Switzerland (4), Sweden, Norway, and France (9,10,11), Austria, Iceland, Germany, and Finland (13,14,15,16) and all have very very low rates of gun crime. Another good example, though not European is Canada, placed 12th in gun ownership per capita while simultaneously having very very low gun crime. Asserting that Europe is a good example of why gun bans are a good idea is a complete non sequitur, as they don't have gun bans and have very low gun crime. Again, this post is specifically about bans, not limitations.\n\n4.) it's not intellectually dishonest if your goal is to save any amount of lives.\n\nThis can be true, but only if you also support the limitations of other personal freedoms like alcohol for the same reasons. It is not logical to say \"I'm willing to take away people's freedom to own guns in order to save lives, but I'm not willing to take away people's freedom to consume alcohol to save lives,\" when alcohol is just as unnecessary and far more lethal than assault weapons. I would not perceive you as being intellectually dishonest if you believed in any and all personal limitations of freedom that can save even the most minuscule number of lives, I would still disagree with you, but there wouldn't be anything dishonest about your stance.\n\nBonus round of miscellaneous things that kill more people per year than any kind of rifle including assault weapons, just for fun;\n\nDrowning in a bathtub (300 so probably more than assault weapons but less than rifles overall)\n\nFalling down the stairs (1600)\n\nFalling out of bed (450)\n\nCell phones if you count texting and driving (6000, which I'm willing to omit as an actual comparison since most people are against texting while driving anyway. Still interesting.)\n\nThe flu (36,000, more than the total of gun deaths from all suicides and homicides, more than 100 times the deaths of any rifle)\n",

            "selftext": "I keep seeing comments along the lines of \"if Sanders doesn't win, then vote Clinton\". This is justified by saying it will split the vote and then the republicans will pick the Supreme Court justices. Which would probably be bad.\n\nMy issue is that the only reason we are faced with that problem is that our voting system is flawed. Until that is fixed, we will continue to be faced with a similar issue every 2-4 years. If we continue to prioritize short term tactical issues over systemic reform, we will always end up with a suboptimal outcome for a single, identifiable reason. It may hurt to rip off the bandaid. But it needs to come off and it won't hurt any less tomorrow and could very well hurt more. What is holding us back right now is first mover bias. No one is willing to vote independent because no one is willing to vote independent. If there was a stronger movement to vote third party, it would be more appealing to do so. \n\nIt looks a lot like the early labor movement. The conditions for workers were clearly awful. Coal miners, for instance, were screwed every was possible. Even people that dislike unions should be able to see that the result was better than the oppressive sweat shops that existed before that. (Case in point: the company store. Unapologetic indentured servitude.) \n\nMany people were angry about it. But anyone that tried to do anything would be fired or worse unless enough people worked together to take advantage of collective bargaining. To get that many people, you need to prove that you can get that many people. Catch 22. \n\nI am fully aware that my vote would be very unlikely to result in a win for a third party candidate. But a winning candidate is not the only way for one's vote to have an effect. Even a vote for a candidate that loses becomes a statistic that can be used to sway future voters. And a third party candidate wouldn't even have to win to lead to change. Just a large enough portion to be difficult to ignore. In this respect, the spoiler effect could even be beneficial. Because it illustrates exactly what is wrong with the current system and would get many people's attention. \n\nWhy am I wrong?\n\nEdit: sorry for the break. I was at it for a few hours last night, but a man's gotta sleep and work and stuff. I'll try to respond to everyone, but it's hard to keep up with. \n\nEdit 2: after some thought I have realized that my issue isn't necessarily with FPTP voting. If the optimal strategy for elections is a modified FPTP system, then I want that one. But I do not believe that the best strategy is one where two self interested private entities that are both funded by the same massive corporations get to effectively decide half of the reasonable options for governance in the U.S. \n\nI'm not sure if I should award deltas to anyone in particular. I still believe that the optimal strategy when neither party and both parties collectively act against our interests is to vote third party with the intention of restructuring the system in such a way that we can hold them more accountable. A vote for either party maintains the status quo. And a nonvote marks you as someone that can't be relied on to put in the effort to support a candidate. ",

            "selftext": "So as crazy as this sounds I honestly believe Trump will become the republican nominee. So lets look at why. \n\n**1. Lets start with polling data:**\n\nAccording to Five Thirty Eight Cruz has a 52% chance of winning Iowa with Trump behind at 31%. However, if you take a look at the most recent polls added to their list, ones from Jan 13 - 19 you Trump is polling either ahead by 1% or behind by 2%. These polls were conducted either before or during the recent announcements by Sarah Palin and Terry Branstad coming out in support of Trump or against Ted Cruz (in Terry's case anyone but Cruz). This will likely cause a drop in Cruz's support in the next few days leading up to the Iowa caucus and with Trump polling ahead of Rubio (the most common third place finisher) he stands to gain the most. \n\n\n**2. Demographics of Iowa:**\n\nIn 2012 the demographics of voters in Iowa were as follows (Trump's and Cruz's numbers are in brackets afterwards). \n\n* 57% male [T: 47% male, C: 22% Female]\n\n* 58% 45+ years old [C: 18% 50+]\n\n* 52% college Degree [T: 32% without college degree]\n\n* 57% Evangelical [T: 44% non-evangelical, C: 20% Evangelical]\n\n* 99% White \n\nThese numbers show that Cruz, who overlaps well with the evangelical vote as compared to Trump, should have a strong lead over Trump. However, the close polling seems to indicate that Trump is making up ground elsewhere with voters. Determining where he is making up the ground is hard, as the two Five Thirty Eight polls listed above polled Likely Voters (LV) which usually do not count voters who have not voted in the past. Similar to Sanders' Trump will likely rally the voters without a college degree in Iowa, who are under represented in polls, and win the state.\n\n**3. Iowa's effect on NH, and current polling in NH**\n\nAccording the Five Thirty Eight Trump is the predicted winner with a 46% chance as opposed to Cruz (who has jumped from third to second) with a 15% chance. Recent polling (Jan 15-18) puts Trump up by between 7 and 20%.  NH demographics, which I wont list out here but have, in the 2008 Republican primary fit better with Trumps voting block then they do with Cruz's. \n\nIowa may have an effect on NH. According the exit polls from the 2008 primary 50% of voters decided in the last week on who to support and 22% in the last month. A win for Trump in Iowa will show that he has the support of the more conservative base while also rallying the independent vote in NH. From there winning the nomination is almost guaranteed as no candidate other then Bill Clinton has won a nomination without winning either Iowa or NH and the best establishment candidate is probably Rubio but without the support of either state it will be unlikely that he will win the nominee. \n\nSo just for the record I put the likely hood of this happening somewhere between 65-75%. The other 45-35% chance comes if Cruz wins Iowa and Rubio somehow manages to win NH then I think we have a Rubio victory.So lets CMV! \n\n\n_____\n\n> *Hello, users of CMV!

If the Obama presidency has shown us anything about the office today it is that the president has little power in domestic politics without a functioning congress. The ACA was shot in the foot before it even passed due to opposition. How will Sanders be able to push through comprehensive health care and wall street reforms without the support of his own party?\n\nThere are many things, mostly her ties to big business, that I don't like about Clinton. However, I think she shines in diplomacy led foreign policy; one of the real powers that the executive branch still seems to have. Due to this I am tempted to vote for her.\n\nOn social issues their seems little disparity. \n\nChange my view!\n\nEDIT 1: Hey everyone, thanks for all the responses, some of which are very detailed.

They are far closer in policy and they have worked together a great deal. Sanders is not the heir to Obama, but instead an entirely different candidate.

He simply preferred him to the alternative. \n\nI've been very disappointed in the way that Sanders seems to be trying to mislead voters in acting as if he is similar to Obama.

            "selftext": "I would like to start by saying that I fully believe in the rights of individuals.  I live in the USA and so I'm going to frame my claim in this context because it is the system I am most familiar with.  I'm going to list several points that have personally led me to believe this to be true.  Also, I am not going to claim that any democracy at any level is a failure, but in terms of governing a large nation-state, democracy does not work.  The definition that I'm going to use for democracy in this argument is **\"a system where everyone has the right to vote\"**.\n\n1. The right to vote is a lie to the masses.  Although this is a right established by many sovereign nations for their citizens, it is purely a way to either suppress the most intelligent and adept individuals in society to go along with what the populous wants.  I don't think the republican and democratic front runners would be Trump and Clinton respectively if we didn't have to acknowledge that many idiots who will vote on one issue (people who hate immigrants, want more welfare, pro life, pro choice, etc...).  I don't believe voting should be eliminated, but I will get to that later.  When Americans turn 16 years old, all citizens aren't awarded drivers licenses - you need to prove you a competent driver and know the rules.  If you want to vote, at the age of 18 you should be required to either take some sort of test regarding how government works (because most people think the president can make laws, etc..) or meet some other requirement based on your service to the nation (like making more than $100,000 dollars or service in the military).  Having voting be an earned privilege would both galvanize people to vote if they went out of their way to receive a license and have people be educated somewhat on how the system works and policy in general.  The goal isn't to construct a system of only elite in power, it is a way to ensure that the best people are chosen to run the nation - **not people who appeal to the most citizens.**  According to [the CIA factbook](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Literacy_in_the_United_States) there is more than 97% literacy in the United States, and there wouldn't be any reason to limit such a test to people who can't understand English (I wouldn't have a problem with such a test being in Spanish or Navajo for example).  I think this is honestly something that is very reasonable and probably constitutional -  it doesn't mean people don't get to vote, it just means that people need to *earn* the right.  \n\n2.  There is no reason to think that democracy is more fair than other ways of reaching decisions.  If you were a black man living in the south during the 1960's and were alleged to have raped a white woman, 100% of the town probably wanted to lynch you.  **Just because 100% of the people want something doesn't make it right.**  I think that is something people really don't think about, there is times when we know having a purely democratic system would be a very bad idea.  Granted, the man would then be put to a jury of his peers who could be just as biased, but this is theoretically a chosen group, (not the entire population) who is voting on his outcome.  You might also be inclined to say that America is a democratic republic - which is true.  However, in a presidential election, that is a process in which the nation democratically chooses a leader (everyone's vote is equal to everyone's and everyone is allowed to participate).  Again, I know the electoral college provides somewhat of a buffer to prevent a totally democratic election, but only have a few number of times has the president with less popular votes has one the election, so I'm willing to say that the presidential election is *functionally democratic* in design.\n\n3.  Having a legislature where **BOTH HOUSES** are elected by popular votes (one based in districts and the other statewide) is destructive.  I feel like the evidence of this is fairly axiomatic.  This system leads to bloated funding because representatives and senators simply want to get reelected so they attempt to appease voters - not get results.  I actually think though that if gerrymandering was eliminated, the House should continue as designed, but the Senate needs to return to appointment.  Having Senators be subject to elections means that there is not a group in power (besides the supreme court) that is purely concerned with the best choices of government but instead getting reelected.  Essentially with the system we have, we just have 2 lower houses (that is a big claim I'm not going to defend, it is just the way I see it and I just wanted to say it).  If we want to see the government working better we need to have more people involved that aren't slaves to votes.\n\nI'll be willing to CMV if you can tell me what I said in most of my points is wrong via a convincing enough argument, or if you are able to convince me that voting is a given right to the masses.  \n\nI don't want to offer my own opinions about ideal government, that is a different discussion.\n\nI also want to note that I am open minded, or at least I think so.\n\n\n\n> *Hello, users of CMV!

I would argue that President's have very little effect on the economy (same as gas prices) and yet people always attribute these things to Presidents, good or bad. The Wall Street crash of '87 was under his watch technically and Salomon brothers was as well, but again, why should Bush get the blame for either? Could this have been caused by whatever deregulation occurred under Reagan/Bush or is it unrelated wholly. And the fact he raised taxes, I think was admirable. \nHe broke a promise but it was because he couldn't strike a deal with the senate and house, controlled by democrats. What I would call compromise, the media and Clinton spun into 'untrustworthy'. I always find it so weird he never had a second term, seeing as what he accomplished diplomatically. \nA brief little list of some things:\n1. Started a good relationship with Gorbachev leading to the reformation of Germany, tearing down the wall, etc.\n2. Deposed Manuel Noriega swiftly\n3. Formed and maintained the coalition during the Gulf War and dissuaded Russia from defending their ally, Iraq.\n\nI know I must be missing a lot of stuff to include in here, but still, I'd like to hear some opposing views if you do not think Bush was a good President.\n_____\n\n> *Hello, users of CMV!

            "selftext": "If you don't know what a super delegate is, it is a delegate that basically gets picked by the party and they get to vote which ever way they want. So 350 super delegates from across the country have already decided that they are voting for Hillary compared to 8 for Bernie Sanders according to AP. So regardless of what the American people want, Clinton gets a 10% advantage over Sanders in this race. There are still 200 undecided super delegates and many of them will likely vote with the populous of their state but my point still stands. \n\nThis means that it is possible for Bernie Sanders to win by a margin of 58 to 42 (basically a landslide) and the democratic party would still nominate Hillary as their candidate. The good news is that Hillary led in super delegates against Obama in 2008 and still lost but this is still absolutely absurd that the party is so anti-democratic yet calls themselves the democrats. It means that the party is blatantly saying that they only care 80% about what the country thinks and that they 20% don't give a shit. \n\nAfter being a democrat I registered as an independent a few years back because I really despise the two party system in this country. The whole concept of super delegates is exactly the type of thing that has given attention to Sanders' campaign. Our system is broken. People need to take the initiative and stand up against it or it will never change. \n\nI think Clinton will end up winning the nomination and I don't think she will need the super delegates to do it but if she does win I believe passionate Sanders supporters should immediately re-register as independents in support of Bernie but still vote for Clinton in the election.\n\nI have heard from many people that they don't want to support the broken system if Bernie loses so they don't want to vote for Hillary. There are also many that feel that the stakes are too high to not vote for Clinton. My solution is to re-register as an independent but still vote for Hillary. This would send a strong message to the party that it needs to clean up it's act and reform.\n\nI believe this would be effective because you would be taken off the democratic parties voter database as a registered democrat which is one of the parties most powerful tools in a general election. \n_____\n\n> *Hello, users of CMV!

            "selftext": "The largest absurdity of voting for Bernie Sanders is that he\u2019s more liberal than Obama. We all just went through two terms of having a president expected to bring about all sorts of change only to be blocked at every turn due to our bipartisan political system. Now these same Democrats think electing an even more liberal president will somehow work better within this same system - I could simply call that textbook insanity and stop here, but let\u2019s continue. \n\n\nSure, Bernie has excellent ideals and is pitching mouth-watering goals, but all verifiable observations show that it\u2019s entirely unlikely that he will accomplish any of them.\n \n>1. Bernie has managed to do little as a senator for the last 8 years (Vermont since 2007): he\u2019s sponsored 356 bills and only 3 of them have become law - that\u2019s a .84% success rate\n>>Here they are: https://www.govtrack.us/congress/bills/browse#congress=113&sponsor=400357&enacted_ex=on\n\n>2. He\u2019s terrible at working with Republicans: he\u2019s been in the bottom 10% of senators who work with the other party for his entire time in office, i.e. Republicans do not sponsor bills with him which decreases the odds of his bills getting passed\n>>Here\u2019s his latest Govtrack report card: https://www.govtrack.us/congress/members/bernard_sanders/400357/report-card/2015\n\n>3. He has poor work references: he\u2019s been endorsed by only 2 Congress members while Hillary has been endorsed by 2/3rds of Congress\n>>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Bernie_Sanders_presidential_campaign_endorsements,_2016\n>>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Hillary_Clinton_presidential_campaign_endorsements,_2016\n\n\nNow, I\u2019d be remised if I didn\u2019t touch on an important factor of these prelims. If Bernie Sanders wins it greatly increases the odds that Donald Trump, or any Republican nominee, will ultimately be the president of America and I just can\u2019t have that. For enough voters Hillary would obviously be the safer candidate if she goes against Trump, but if Bernie goes against Trump it\u2019s going to be this huge Turd Sandwich vs Giant Douche debacle in which case we practically have a coin toss. \n\n\nI\u2019m fine with having a president that gets only a little done, that can be jot down to the pros and cons of a balanced system, but if America progresses backwards I\u2019ll be fucking pissed.\n\nI don\u2019t want to make this any longer, but Hillary will get more - of the right things - done. \n\n>1. She\u2019s known for being able to work with both parties and has more national level successes under her belt\n>>http://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2015/09/carly-fiorina-debate-hillary-clintons-greatest-accomplishment-213157\n>>https://www.hillaryclinton.com/feed/seven-hillary-clintons-biggest-accomplishments/\n\n>2. For the most part, Hillary shares the same views as Bernie\n>>http://presidential-candidates.insidegov.com/compare/35-40/Bernie-Sanders-vs-Hillary-Clinton\n>>http://www.businessinsider.com/hillary-clinton-vs-bernie-sanders-on-the-issues-2015-9\n\n>3. And while Hillary having Bill Clinton on her side is unfair to consider, in a way, it would only be a benefit to America and that\u2019s what this is all about. \n\nPlease vote for Hillary in the upcoming prelims. We need a president willing to compromise in a liberal direction, not an idealist who the majority of congress won't work with.",

However Europe is just one continent. And I feel like you would be just as valid to say that the US is normal and Europe is too far left for it\u2019s own good (though I don\u2019t think this). Where you define the center of the political spectrum seems entirely up to the person that\u2019s designing it and open to that person\u2019s bias of who they think is too far left or right.  \nCould you argue that the center is having no strong feelings one way or the other. Okay, but that\u2019s not really a political position, it\u2019s just a lack of interest in politics. What about issues where there doesn\u2019t seem to really be any middle ground. How do you define center there?\n\nI couldn\u2019t really think of any consistent way to define the location of the center part of the political spectrum. So Reddit, can you show me that there is a consistent center of the political spectrum and the US is actually way to the right and the EU is normal (or the other way around)?

I don't think this is a fair criticism: I think the American financial system is crucial to American prosperity and our way of life, and I think our politicians *should* be doing everything in their power to keep it that way. Here's why:\n\n* The US is, fairly, the largest economy in the world. If you look at [the globe by GDP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_GDP_(nominal), only the European Union is larger, and that's a group of 28 countries. If the US were to form a similar arrangement with either Canada or Mexico (or both), we would easily be the largest economy on earth. The US achieved this because our financial markets are the best in the world. Our 2 largest stock exchanges, the New York Stock Exchange and the NASDAQ, [are together more than 4x larger than the next competitor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_stock_exchanges) (the London Stock Exchange Group), and larger than the following 7 combined. America does 3 things very well: finance, entertainment, and military force; and the last two funnel back into our economic dominance. \n\n* The comfort and safety that Americans enjoy is directly related to our economic dominance. Because our markets are so strong, in America: credit is inexpensive and easy to obtain, we have tremendous international political muscle, our currency is stable, and we are virtually immune from intrastate conflicts. Other countries lend us money at *negative* interest rates, because we're such a safe investment: creating global interdependence, which leads to easy foreign relations. We won the Cold War not because of mutually-assured destruction, but because our markets could sustain the conflict while the Soviet Union could not. Our markets keep us safe and assure that our politicians can negotiate global politics from a position of strength.\n\n*  The strength of our financial markets make the lives of average Americans better. Granted: Americans borrow money for things that citizens of other nations would never have to finance: a college education, medical expenses, time off for childcare, etc. But we also have the option to finance tremendous luxury at relatively low interest rates, if we so choose. Further: we have the opportunity to grow our savings and investments in perhaps the most stable and positive-returning markets in the world. As above: it would be nice to have a guaranteed retirement and social safety net, but that isn't currently part of our system and we won't get it by weakening Wall Street. Our financial system, minus its occasional hiccups, produces long-term sustainable growth: growth that is needed to sustain our growing population and economy.\n\nAll of this is not to say that income and wealth inequality isn't (perhaps) the biggest problem facing America today. But I don't think we solve it by weakening the economic engines that produce the vast majority of our wealth. We could, instead, tax *all* income as income by eliminating the capital gains tax rate (outside of post-tax investments like Roth IRAs) and lowering or eliminating the estate tax exemption: tax money when people take it home and not when it's being used for further investment and growth. \n\nOverall, Wall Street is a huge part of the safety, stability, and quality of life of Americans. Politicians *should* be concerned with maintaining and growing that sector of our economy: the same way that they should (proportionally) be concerned about *all* business in the US. Wall Street gets the most attention because it's the 'biggest fish in the pond', but 'pro-business' is 'pro-business'. Let's remember, too, that Wall Street and the other major industries that took money from the TARP program paid that money back, with interest: to the tune of $15.4 billion dollars *profit* to the taxpayers. Even when they fuck up, Wall Street has the means to make it right. \n\n_____\n\n> *Hello, users of CMV! This is a footnote from your moderators. We'd just like to remind you of a couple of things.

Also, her favorable/unfavorable rating are much lower than Sanders, and she appears to be more divisive than Sanders on many issues. \n\nLastly, Hillary has only one election in her entire life, a senate race after her husband had been President for 8 years.

I base my opinion on three points:\n\n**IT'S INCREDIBLY CONSEQUENTIAL**\n\nThe war's tangible toll includes: [4491 US Troops, 318 Other Troops, 1554 Contractors] killed (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iraq_War), 117,961 total wounded,  [In excess of 500,000 total killed (mostly civilians)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Casualties_of_the_Iraq_War), [$2.2 Trillion direct and as much as $6 Trillion spent just in the US](http://www.reuters.com/article/us-iraq-war-anniversary-idUSBRE92D0PG20130314). The war also de-stabilized the region, and can be seen as the primary cause of the subsequent unrest including the [Syrian Civil War](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syrian_Civil_War) and the rise of [ISIS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Islamic_State_of_Iraq_and_the_Levant).\n\nThe intangible costs of the war run much deeper. They can be seen in the lack of US support for ground presence in Syria, the approximately 6500 veteran suicides per year, even the rise of reactionary Nationalist movements in the US and Europe coinciding with the [European Migrant Crisis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_migrant_crisis) and the increasing financial strains on the federal government. Quite simply, the Iraq War is the single most consequential political decision in more than a generation. **But even worse, it was a binary decision** - it could quite conceivably never have happened. The difference between major political views on most issues are on a sliding scale: high tax rate vs. a lower one, more health care coverage vs. less and so on. All of the tangible consequences of the war and many of the intangible ones hinge solely on the decision to invade.\n\n**IT'S UTTERLY INDEFENSIBLE**\n\nIn recent years, Hillary Clinton, her supporters and unrelated others have engaged in [historic revisionism](http://www.dailykos.com/story/2016/2/4/1480069/-Enough-of-the-Iraq-War-Revisionism-Hillary-Voted-for-War) with regards to the Iraq vote. I can only address some of their claims here: Most Democrats did not support the war: A majority of Democratic congressmen [voted AGAINST the war](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iraq_Resolution#United_States_House_of_Representatives). At the time of her Iraq vote [a majority of both Democrats and Liberals](http://www.gallup.com/poll/7699/blacks-postgraduates-among-groups-most-likely-oppose-iraq-invasion.aspx) opposed the Iraq war. In fact, at the time of the Iraq vote (October 2002), [a plurality of ALL Americans](http://usatoday30.usatoday.com/news/poll1007.htm) did not support an Iraq war, did not feel that the US had done enough to prevent it and felt that Congress should have the final say on whether the US should invade or not - a responsibility the Iraq War vote explicitly abdicated. A report by chief UN weapons inspector Hans Blix declared there was [no evidence](http://www.cnn.com/2003/US/03/07/sprj.irq.un.transcript.blix/) that Saddam Hussein had either restarted his chemical/biological weapons program or possessed WMDs. Iraq, for its part [welcomed](http://www.un.org/apps/news/story.asp?NewsID=6383) increased inspection in the lead-up to the war but these inspectors were [recalled immediately prior to the bombings](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations_Monitoring,_Verification_and_Inspection_Commission). Hillary Clinton also voted against the [Levin Amendment](http://www.nytimes.com/2007/03/01/opinion/01chafee.html?_r=1) and [Durbin Amendment](http://www.senate.gov/legislative/LIS/roll_call_lists/roll_call_vote_cfm.cfm?congress=107&session=2&vote=00236) which would've limited Bush's War authority to the UN-related and Immediate national security related concerns Clinton's supporters now claim her vote was about.  In short, the Iraq war occured without any conclusive evidence to justify it and with majority opposition from Hillary Clinton's ideological peers. The fact the run up to the war, including evidence of WMDs was explicitly split on ideological lines should say more than enough about where Hillary Clinton stood in her Iraq policy.\n\nBy [mid-2003](http://www.un.org/press/en/2003/sc7777.doc.htm), it was clear to the UN that there was no evidence of WMDs in Iraq. It was despite this lack of evidence then, that Clinton [argued for an ESCALATION of the Iraq War](http://www.nytimes.com/2005/07/13/nyregion/the-evolution-of-hillary-clinton.html) long after its WMD/National Security rationale had been debunked. This could only be interpreted as an explicit endorsement of nation-building with the US Military. In summary, contemporaneous evidence clearly contradicts Hillary Clinton's rationale for her Iraq vote, and the fact that she's making excuses at all implies that it was far more than simply an accident or mistake.\n\n**IT'S STILL RELEVANT TODAY**\n\nEven besides its continuing consequences, the Iraq vote provides representative insight into Hillary Clinton's foreign policy. She has continued her support of regime change in Libya and Syria, and her support of a No-Fly-Zone puts her in a more hawkish position than most Democrats (including Bernie Sanders and Barack Obama) and many prominent Republicans (Donald Trump, Ted Cruz, Rand Paul). Her initial approval for [ground troops](http://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2015/nov/19/hillary-clinton-isis-strategy-ground-troops-airstrikes-no-fly-zone-syria) in Syria put her in a more hawkish position than even most Republicans before she [walked it back](http://www.ibtimes.com/hillary-clinton-flip-flopping-ground-troops-fight-isis-us-sends-troops-iraq-clinton-2206261). Her defense of the vote extended well into her first Presidential Campaign, long past the time other political opportunists walked away from their decisions, and the historical revisionism I discussed in the previous section arguably represents a defense not just of her vote but of a real philosophy behind the vote. Of the major 2016 candidates, and certainly all of the libertarian/progressive ones, Hillary Clinton is unquestionably among the most likely to put the US in a future Iraq-like quagmire in Iraq, Syria, Iran or somewhere unforeseen. Given the immense consequences of such an outcome as outlined in the first section, Hillary Clinton's support of Iraq and continued hawkishness outweigh any potentially-redeeming quality make her candidacy for Commander-in-Chief a non-starter to anyone uninterested in repeating the mistakes of Iraq.\n_____\n\n> *Hello, users of CMV!

To me, the whole thing is unbearably undemocratic, and while I do believe that a Hillary presidency would be better (if only marginally) than a Cruz or Trump presidency, I feel like validating the cronyism of the political system will only allow this sort of undemocratic behavior to continue unchecked.\n\nI feel like all we can do is send the message that our votes aren't guaranteed, and that the party must win them every election with a solid platform and transparent process, not a vapid coronation of an heir-apparent candidate.\n\nEDIT:\n\nTo reiterate: My decision has nothing to do with Hillary.  It's about the apparent decision of the DNC to deprive voters fair access to the democratic process by scheduling only 6 debates on off hours (down from 26 last time), the decision of Media outlets like CNN to let their financial contributions to her campaign seemingly affect their coverage, and the decision of state Democratic officials like in Iowa to fudge and obfuscate the process.  A vote against Hillary is, in my view, a vote against seeming party cronysim and the sense that a candidate may be an heir-apparent, needing no challenger and meriting no debate.",

            "selftext": "The way I see it, a President's powers are most direct in the areas of foreign policy and national security strategy. In this sense, I like that Sanders isn't a hawk and is good on privacy rights with the NSA. Those two issues almost exclusively determine who I vote for in a presidential race (I was a Rand Paul supporter before he dropped out -- I lean Republican on other issues not particularly relevant here). While a President may be able to advocate a domestic agenda from the bully pulpit, ultimately they will need the blessing of Congress to pass big reforms within our borders. In my view, a presidential candidate's efficacy should be judged on:\n\n1. Their foreign policy/national security policy.\n2. Their ability to work with Congress to pass reforms. This includes their ability to meet with political opponents, listen to them, and try to reach across the aisle and compromise. \n3. Their ability to delegate powers to a skilled, competent, and experienced cabinet. \n4. Their ability to to represent the country on the world stage as a charismatic and respectable leader (the \"figurehead\" role of a President which is really important for soft power and national image)\n\nAssuming Republicans maintain control of a good portion of the House and Senate, how can Sanders expect to advance his domestic agenda? A divided government would severely limit his powers in advancing the main areas of his platform -- tax increases on the \"1%,\" wealth redistribution, free healthcare, free public college, etc. With a Republican majority in at least one house of Congress, he'd have a very difficult time passing any sort of tax hikes or budget increases to fund his policies. This my be unpopular to say on Reddit, but Bernie Sanders isn't much of a compromiser, and certainly wouldn't be willing to cooperate with GOP leadership -- for better or for worse. Not compromising on ideological principle works in the Senate as an senior Senator from an easy-to-win state, but that will not work in the White House. \n\nMore problematically for Sanders, I reckon that on some issues, he would even have a difficult time building coalitions with his own party (think Blue Dog Democrats and pro-Wall Street Democrats like Senator Clinton). The business community has significant influence in certain parts of the Democratic Party, particularly in the House where some Democrats may have major corporations in their districts as the principal employers of their constituents. He has always been abrasive, even within his own party, and has a record of clashing with Democrats in Congress. If you don't believe me on this, [take Barney Frank](http://articles.latimes.com/1991-09-08/news/mn-2854_1_major-party): \n\n>\u201cBernie alienates his natural allies. His holier-than-thou attitude\u2014saying in a very loud voice he is smarter than everyone else and purer than everyone else\u2014really undercuts his effectiveness.\u201d\n\nWith all this in mind, I think that a Sanders Administration could seriously run the chance of implementing fewer domestic reforms than anybody else in the race. His ideological purism limits his ability to pass, fund, and implement his agenda. These policies sound great in a campaign speech, but are not pragmatic in the real world where it counts.

Now no one wants to pay more for consumer goods because there's a bubble in the cost of their futures' contracts, but this solution just seems ham-handed and naive. I've taken some economics and finance classes (and forgot neraly everything from them lol), but this reminds me of some articles we read in one or the other about how governments would try to outlaw short-selling, to protect the domestic economy. Surely investors will find a way.

            "selftext": "Couple of key points:\n\n1. I am supporting Sanders in this election. I frankly don't like Hillary, but what I really loathe is when people throw the terms \"illegal\" and \"jail\" around without any sort of idea what they're talking about.\n2. I really would like my view changed, but in order to that I am going to ask for specific sections to actual laws, and if necessary for examples of cases which support your interpretation of the law.\n3. It doesn't matter if the laws are good, bad, well-or-poorly written, or even whether they imply something. It matters what they actually do say, and how they have been interpreted by a court. So arguments about whether it was a good idea, whether it put us at danger, and similar arguments will not change my view because they do nothing to assist the argument that a law was broken.\n4. The argument that 'a regular government employee would already be in jail' is invalid. The laws in this case differ specifically between an employee of a government agency, and the appointed official who sets the protocols for that agency. edit: Or please source the relevant law which applies and suggests otherwise. edit edit: A good example would be how the laws differ in application between enlisted personnel versus officers. Clinton was an official appointed to run the State Department, not someone who worked for the State Department. If you can give an example of another Secretary of State going to jail for less then this would be a valid example.  \n\nThat is all. Have a nice day.\n_____\n\n> *Hello, users of CMV!

            "selftext": "[I'm referring to this video](https://youtu.be/w5llLIKM9Yc) \n\nDelegates are elected by the population. This is what DWS was referring to. Not the primary candidates. Unpledged delegates can, and do, switch their support to whomever wins the popular vote in the primaries / caucuses (there are some exceptions, of course; however, the majority of them do). \n\nWe saw this in 2007 with Obama v Clinton. This is such a non-issue that it's ridiculous that it's being brought up again. \n\nWhat DWS is referring to is the election of delegates. Any member of the Democratic Party is eligible to be a delegate. Of course electeds and party officials would want to be included in the process. If it was just a general election, all of those folks would be eligible to run (and probably would). So consider this: the average Democratic voter decides to run for delegate, but the Congressperson from the same district wants to run too. Who is going to win? More than likely, the person with more name recognition and notoriety (ie the Congressional member). \n\nThe reason that the Superdelegates (who are unpledged) exist is to give every member of the Democratic party a chance to be a part of the political system and process. It is not to serve the DNC. As history has shown, Superdelegates (again, who are unpledged *) can and *do** change their allegiance according to the popular vote. \n\nThis nitpicking and selective quoting is disingenuous at best and outright lying at worst. They support a given candidate and act as surrogates for them at campaign events, but that would happen no matter what. It's better to consider them similar to campaign surrogates who have endorsed someone for their own benefit. Sucks, but until Citizens United is overturned, this is what we live with due to PAC money. \n\nThere are no nefarious intentions behind this. It is done to make the delegate selection process as inclusive as possible and to enfranchise as many people as possible. If you watch the full video, DWS clearly elaborates and explains that. \n\nFWIW I'm not a DWS fan, and I cannot wait until she is no longer the Chairwoman of the DNC. But this is a huge load of shit and selective quoting by people trying to get a rise out of the electorate.",

            "selftext": "**TL;DR: The revolution Bernie is relying on to achieve change isn't going to work out especially under a Republican Congress, so a Bernie presidency = no change. Hillary can achieve incremental change, which is better than no change.**\n\nWe're facing the choice of sticking with the safer choice or going for broke with the revolutionist. Bernie's chances of success are completely dependent on [a revolution led by ordinary people](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8jV4sv9waB0&t=5m28s), and I'm sad to say I don't think this revolution is going to work.\n\n**Bernie supporters: please don't just downvote me. I will change my vote if you can change my view.**\n\nI've been disillusioned by the lack of progress Democrats have made. It was a huge disappointment that Clinton didn't lead us to universal healthcare in the 90s, a time when *everyone* was in agreement that we were overdue for an overhaul of the system, to the point that even Republicans were coming up with plans for universal healthcare, albeit weak ones that probably wouldn't have worked. And yet Republicans killed the momentum, associating universal healthcare with socialism and popularizing the idea that \"there's gotta be a better way,\" sure everyone wants to fix the problem but no one can agree on how to do it, so nothing happens.\n\nAt the time, I was frustrated with Hillary. I thought she was compromising with conservatives too much and conservatives were never going to cooperate. I thought, there are all these plans out there; we should just go with one of them already because any of them would be better than what we have now, and things are getting worse. I thought, we just need to convince people that the moral thing to do is to treat healthcare as a right. And that's what Bernie is doing--I think I would be all for Bernie ten years ago, but I'm even more disillusioned now. I was moved [when Hillary said,](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/post-politics/wp/2015/08/18/clinton-tells-black-lives-matter-activists-to-focus-on-ways-to-change-policy-not-change-hearts/)\n\n> I don't believe you change hearts. I believe you change laws, you change allocation of resources, you change the way systems operate. You're not going to change every heart. You\u2019re not. But at the end of the day, we could do a whole lot to change some hearts and change some systems and create more opportunities for people who deserve to have them, to live up to their own God-given potential, to live safely without fear of violence in their own communities, to have a decent school, to have a decent house, to have a decent future. So we can do it one of many ways. You can keep the movement going, which you have started, and through it you may actually change some hearts. But if that's all that happens, we'll be back here in 10 years having the same conversation. We will not have all of the changes that you deserve to see happen in your lifetime because of your willingness to get out there and talk about this.\n\nAnd I'm starting to believe she's right, as uninspiring as that sounds. I'm thinking Bernie can do more good if he keeps preaching and changing some hearts outside of \"the establishment\", and we need a more pragmatic negotiator on the inside.\n\nObama's failure to achieve what we hoped he could made me think even more that we need a pragmatic approach. I think it's very telling that [Obama said Hillary was right and ultimately signed the ACA, which resembled the plan Hillary had been pushing for all along much more than than his.](http://www.nationalaffairs.com/publications/detail/the-clintonian-roots-of-obamacare) Hillary learned from experience and she knows what works and what doesn't.\nBut I actually feel inspired now by [the audacity of political realism,](http://www.vox.com/2016/1/28/10858464/hillary-clinton-bernie-sanders-political-realism) because you know what? We are much better off now with the ACA. I for one sure have benefited. The ACA isn't perfect but it was a huge accomplishment, really the only progress we've seen in universal healthcare going back to Truman, and we have the opportunity to build on the ACA and help more people. And the person who can be the best successor to Obama is Hillary, as [Obama himself seems to suggest.](http://www.politico.com/story/2016/01/obama-iowa-2016-sanders-off-message-218166)\n\nWhen I bring this up with Bernie supporters they've argued that Bernie can negotiate too, he's worked across the aisle before. But what has Bernie accomplished doing that? He's brought up veteran legislation, but he was also very unhappy with what little came from that. Hillary got S-CHIP, foster care reform (working with Tom DeLay of all people!), certainly deserves played a major role in getting the ACA passed, and more. Bernie [exaggerated his role in writing the ACA and only begrudgingly voted for it.](http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2016/jan/18/bernie-s/fact-checking-bernie-sanders-claim-he-helped-write/) I was also concerned about Bernie's negotiation skills when he argued for meeting with our enemies without conditions in the most recent debate. Bernie may ultimately compromise on his plans which most pundits and calling wildly unrealistic, but I feel better going for the candidate who is most likely going to be better at negotiating, who has already fought hard for healthcare reform and learned important lessons from that, lessons I don't want to wait for Bernie to learn in office. Hillary also has more clout in the Democratic party which I think is critical for getting things done.\n\nWhat Bernie has in his favor is that he realizes, in ways Obama didn't, that he can't inspire a Republican Congress to get on board by himself. He says that it's critical that we have a revolution led by ordinary people. But is that going to work? I'm not optimistic. Social media makes it look like Bernie is gaining awesome momentum, but looking at polls (and looking at how popular Trump is turning out to be, I'm deeply concerned) I don't think he's got enough people. [And voter turnout is shaping up to be lower than in 2008](http://m.huffpost.com/us/entry/voter-turnout_n_2088810.html) so it looks to me that Bernie isn't inspiring as many people as Obama did, and we know how that turned out. And if people can't even get out and vote, what are the chances they're going to keep up the revolution after the election? And if they do, what can they even do, realistically? Most likely even less people are going to turn up for critical midterms. Bernie's supporters can hold petitions and protests, but I hate to say this, when's the last time those things made a significant impact? How well have Occupy Wall Street and Black Lives Matter turned out? On the flip side, Hillary has been vigorously attacked for decades and she's still standing strong, and I can't imagine what else her opponents could throw at her. I don't think Bernie will fare as well, and Republicans have yet to attack him ([some have even bolstered his campaign,](http://www.bloomberg.com/politics/articles/2016-01-19/republican-operatives-are-trying-to-help-bernie-sanders) possibly because they see him easier to beat).\n\nMoreover, if Bernie wins, we could be looking at a Republican counterrevolution that could set us back from making any progress, similar how the 90s healthcare reform fizzled out. On the flip side, Hillary has been vigorously attacked for decades, arguably more than any other political figure, and she's still standing strong, so I think she would fare better.\n\nBernie's great, but the president doesn't have that much power anyway. I'd like him to continue doing good work in the Senate, where he can vote and introduce legislation, which he can't do as President. But the President is in a unique position to convince Congress members to change their votes, and I think Hillary would be better that. Bernie would be a good partner in the Senate; Hillary would have less of an impact there than she would as President.\n\nI also have other concerns about Bernie, such as his lack of knowledge on foreign policy and lack of advisors (a 2002 vote is not a plan to defeat ISIS), his class-first approach to disparities and how he's responding to minority activists, and I think even if by some miracle he gets his health reform passed (he can't), it's not the right way to go--I favor getting a handle on costs first and then moving towards single payer down the line, which is going to take more than 8 years. But, my main hangup is I don't see Bernie being effective as a president. So, if you can convince me Bernie's revolution is going to work and he will achieve change, I'll change my view.",

            "selftext": "Donald Trump is dismantling the GOP as we know it one Bible-thumping conservative at a time.  He blamed Bush for 9/11.  He condemned the Iraq War before AND after it. He's called the Pope Pathetic.  He's come out in support of Planned Parenthood (in terms of women's health issues).  All things that are very un-republican.  Finally, he doesn't rely on ANYONE's opinion to fund his campaign.  Not corporations or ours frankly.   Trump is anti-establishment. \n\nBernie Sanders is not anti-establishment. \n\nLet me just first begin by pointing out that [Bernie Sanders got elected with the help of the NRA](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/how-the-nra-helped-put-bernie-sanders-in-congress/2015/07/19/ed1be26c-2bfe-11e5-bd33-395c05608059_story.html). So right off the bat, the Bern was in the pocket of the gun lobbyists.  Sounds pretty establishment to me.    \n\nSecondly, Bernie Sanders is not shaking up the left like Trump is shaking up the right.  He's a Liberal.   Yes, he's slightly more to the left than Hillary but at the end of the day, he voted with her [93% of the time in the Senate](http://www.nytimes.com/2015/05/28/upshot/the-senate-votes-that-divided-hillary-clinton-and-bernie-sanders.html?_r=0).   Calling out the billionaires and crooked bankers is nothing new but it just looks really profound when you compare him to Hillary who might be the most corrupt politician of our time.  Not many Democrats disagree that we should raise the taxes on the super rich, not even Hilary who is in bed with the super rich.  \n\nSo I guess I should define what anti-establishment means in this election.   An anti-establishment candidate is a game changer (for better or worse).  Someone who is actually changing the paradigm of American politics.   Not accepting large donations or money from Super Pacs is a start.  But at the end of the day we're talking about a career politician here, who has been a textbook liberal his whole career (with the exception of the NRA endorsement).  \n\nI support a lot of what Bernie Sanders says.  But please explain to me how he is a game changer if elected President. \n\nELABORATION EDIT: Sanders hasn't shaken things up or exposed the bullshit going on in his own party enough to be called the anti-establishment candidate.  What are  his big \"anti-establishment\" positions? \n\n*Campaign Finance Reform?  So what? [Hillary is proposing a constitutional amendment to repeal Citizens United too](https://www.hillaryclinton.com/briefing/factsheets/2015/09/08/restore-integrity-to-elections/). \n\n*Going after Wall Street? [So is she.](https://www.hillaryclinton.com/briefing/factsheets/2016/01/14/clinton-is-the-candidate-with-the-toughest-plan-to-broadly-tackle-risk-on-wall-street-and-in-our-financial-system/)\n\n*No Money From Super PACs? [Yes there is](http://www.politicususa.com/2016/02/01/bernie-sanders-super-pac-money-democratic-rivals.html)",

            "selftext": "This is not a debate over the merits of their individual policies or platforms. I am also not going to be persuaded by any polls that are out now, as the hypothetical matchup polls this early on in the process tend to favor candidates with the most name recognition. I am also not arguing that a Kasich-Rubio ticket *would* defeat Clinton or Sanders, just that they would be the most likely to out of the current lot of Republican candidates. To change my view you would need to tell me which Republican ticket would fare better than Kasich-Rubio and why. \n\nSo here's why I think they stand the best chance:\n\n1) Ohio and Florida. Kasich has [a very high approval rating](http://www.politico.com/story/2015/10/poll-john-kasich-ohio-approval-numbers-214549) in Ohio as does [Rubio in Florida](http://www.tampabay.com/blogs/the-buzz-florida-politics/rubio-gets-highest-job-approval-rating-in-new-florida-poll/2242705). Obviously, Ohio and Florida are the two biggest battleground states, and if the Republicans were able to carry both of them that would seriously tilt the odds in their favor. \n\n2) Governors have an edge. Since Carter, four out of six presidents were former governors. That's good for Kasich, who will be able to dodge any questions about his experience or qualifications. \n\n3) The VP generally needs to be a senator, or otherwise a long tenure as a representative. Marco Rubio fits that bill. \n\n4) Both of them are the most moderate in the pack of Republican candidates (insane rhetoric they're required to throw around during the primary cycle notwithstanding). They have the greatest appeal to independents and moderate voters.\n\n5) If Hillary Clinton nominates Julian Castro, who's considered by many to be her most likely VP pick, Marco Rubio would have a serious advantage over him when it comes to experience, especially since they are both young and hispanic and have comparable backgrounds. \n\n6) Jeb Bush has too much family baggage to win the primary, much less the general. Cruz is insane and would be destroyed in the general. And there's no way Trump could win in the general, barring some insane October surprise that completely derailed Clinton's chances (though I do think Trump would probably win over Sanders).  ",

            "selftext": "I'd like to start this off by saying that I am *NOT* doing this to comment on the merit or validity of the policies of any of the candidates for president, nor am I endorsing one candidate over the other in this post.\n\nOf course Sanders supporters want Sanders to be president (hence why they are Sanders supporters), so this effect of hugely boosting Republican chances is not at all intentional, but I think they are having as positive an influence as far as a Republican becoming president in 2016 is concerned as any Republican candidate could have themselves.  I think this is solidified no matter who wins the Democratic or Republican nomination.\n\n***FIRST***, let's look at the ideal scenario for Sanders supporters - despite a massive setback yesterday in Nevada, Sanders' campaign somehow does gains yet another massive swell of momentum in the week-ish before Super Tuesday, does very well on that most important of the primary days, and carries that momentum on to win (and win big) in other states and convince some of Hillary's \"superdelegates\" to support him.  Sanders, against all the odds, has won the Democratic nomination.\n\nThis is a dream scenario not only for Sanders supporters, but for the Republicans as well.  I know that Sanders is currently polling better against Republican candidates than Clinton is (hell, /r/sandersforpresident hits everyone over the head with that as often as possible), but I don't buy that for a second.  One of the main reasons Sanders is polling ahead of Clinton among general election polls is that Republicans have spent maybe an hour each talking about Sanders while they have spent the last decade(ish) attacking Clinton.  While that might seem that it hurts Clinton, it also means that Clinton has pretty much hit her bottom as far as the right's opinion of her is concerned.  Anything further said against her just isn't going to lower her standing much more than what has already been tossed around.  Sanders, however, is a yet-to-be-opened Christmas present for Republicans.  He's a self-styled Socialist, and even if the socialism he espouses isn't the socialism that the United States was terrified of in the 1950s, socialism is still a *very* dirty word to the majority of the country.  That alone might cost him the race.  Tack on to that the fact that the rest of his stances outside of economics (climate change, foreign policy, civil rights) are far left of where most of the country stands, and he would give the Republicans a literal field day when attacking him, and I have no doubt that his numbers would plummet.  Finally, he's an agnostic Jew.  And while that shouldn't really have any bearing in a country that is secular by the demands of the constitution, it is still a dealbreaker for many.  Whether you agree or not that this should be the case, you have to be a Christian to win a national election in the United States at this point in time.  And Sanders isn't.  In addition to that reasoning, [these political scientists (who know a lot more than I do) also give their views on why Sanders supporters claims of his electability are massively over-exaggerated.](http://www.vox.com/2016/2/5/10923304/bernie-sanders-general-election)\n\nTo sum up (and bring it back to my original point), Sanders has very little shot in the general election in my mind, and his supporters, if they got him the Democratic nomination, would have unintentionally given the Republicans their dream candidate to run against and have also given the Republican candidate's chances of winning the White House a massive boost.\n\n***SECOND***, let's move on to the far more likely scenario - Hillary Clinton, after restoring some order to her campaign with a victory in Nevada, gets the Democratic nomination as many expected all along.  Here, I think, Sanders supporters have done the most damage, because while Sanders himself has very admirably refrained from \"attack politics,\" his supporters most certainly have not.  The front page of reddit is constantly flooded with posts about how evil or corrupt or manipulative Hillary Clinton is, and those posts are not just from /r/sandersforpresident or /r/politics (which might just as well be called /r/sandersforpresident2).  This is not only limited to reddit, as twitter and facebook are constantly hit with the same kind of posts, and many of Sanders' supporters also take these views with them when they go to march or demonstrate or rally.  And while this may increase their enthusiasm for Sanders, crucially it is also making them despise Hillary.  Which means that when Hillary wins the Democratic nomination, many Sanders supporters will have such negative opinions of her that they either won't vote at all or they'll vote for the Republican candidate or a third-party candidate.  The vitriol being spewed towards Hillary, warranted or not, is going to massively increase voter apathy among the left (especially the young left) once Hillary wins the nomination, and therefore the efforts of Sanders supporters to paint Hillary as worse than Sanders will end up being a massive boost for however the Republican nominee ends up being.\n\nTO SUM IT ALL UP, Sanders supporters are (unintentionally) providing a massive boost towards the Republicans' chances of winning the presidency in 2016.  Sanders is a much less electable candidate than Hillary in a general election, so if he gets the nomination his supporters will have boosted the GOP's chances in that way, and if Hillary wins the nomination, the amount of attacks and negativity that Sanders' supporters have launched at Hillary will lead to a huge amount of voter apathy among those who supported Sanders, therefore providing the Republicans with a massive boost in that way.\n\nOnce again, I am not here to comment on which candidate I agree with most, the validity of Sanders' supporters attacks on Clinton, whether they are doing this intentionally, or whether or not a Republican in the White House would be a bad thing.  I am just here to say that I believe that Sanders' supporters are providing a massive boost to Republican chances of winning the presidency this year.\n\nChange My View.\n\nEdit: Remember, people, downvotes don't change views.  So far all I've gotten are downvotes, no reasons or arguments except for one that I frankly don't agree with at all and think that data, not just opinion, refutes easily.\n_____\n\n> *Hello, users of CMV!

            "selftext": "I admittedly have a limited worldview on this so I'm genuinely interested in counter arguments for this. \n\nIt basically comes down to the fact that I think, in Western society, that men and women are equal. Let me outline my reasons for thinking this:\n\n1) **Wage Gap**\n\nI don't believe that the wage gap exists because of patriarchal oppression, but because it is self inflicted by women on themselves. They generally choose lower paying careers and on top of that also need to take maternity leave, both of which contributes to average salary being lower than men's.\n\n2) **Leadership**\n\nI don't think women are looked down upon when they hold some type of leadership role. Sure, it seems less common, but that doesn't mean that they are being oppressed out of it. I mean Hillary Clinton is a serious candidate for the 2016 election, there are many other women world leaders over in Europe, and I specifically remember seeing Yahoo CEO Marissa Mayer being on the cover of Forbes some years ago. All of this is taking place without any cultural uproar about them leading countries or companies as a woman. The argument to explain the lack of women in leadership roles can also be lumped into the one explaining the wage gap.\n\n3) **Objectification**\n\nYes, women are objectified by society. They are plastered all over marketing materials for ad campaigns, attractive women are admired as they walk down the street, etc. But so are men. So is any attractive human being. Sure, women are catcalled more, but I believe that comes from our normal sexual dynamic of men being the aggressors. Women love assertive men, it's just that some men don't know or don't care about being tactful while expressing interest. A woman might get approached in a bar when she's only there to be with her friends, but I've also heard plenty of stories of attractive men being openly groped by women who think it's ok because \"all men like attention\". \n\n4) **Reproductive Health** \n\nOne argument that this is lopsided in men's favor is that:\n\n> Women are restricted to access to birth control, and abortion. While men can easily go get viagra or a vasectomy without having a waiting period on whether or not it's a good idea (like women have to do with abortions).\n\nThe problem with this argument is that it should be obvious why it's more difficult to abort a fetus vs getting a vasectomy: one is taking away what could grow to be a child, while the other is simply killing sperm cells. Of course there are going to be more hoops to jump through for an abortion, it's a big irreversible decision to make, vs a vasectomy's ability to be reversed. (Disclaimer: I am pro-choice, but there's no denying the difference these these two procedures) \n\n5) **Men face issues too**\n\nThere are also issues that men are clearly at a disadvantage. Any domestic dispute whether it's a divorce, or custody battle, or rape allegations, men are often seen as guilty until proven innocent despite the justice system advocating the opposite. Not to mention the lack of support for male rape victims.\n\nOverall, there are shitty aspects to being either gender. Let me be clear, I am *not* arguing that women are never treated unjustly. What I am saying is that both genders in western society are equal to one another. We must certainly push to right the wrongs that both gender face, but the right now I think that the claim that \"men are better off than women\", at least in the West, is outdated. \n\n_____\n\n> *Hello, users of CMV!

In my view, he went from being a long shot candidate to a very real challenge to Clinton, but now he's a bit of a long shot again. I understand that he has made yuuuge gains in the polls and is certainly competitive nationally, but the fact is that he needed to win Iowa and/or Nevada to ~~continue~~ boost his momentum *enough to gain sufficient support in Super Tuesday states*. While he is close to Clinton in terms of delegates, he is set to get absolutely crushed on Super Tuesday. Just look at the [RCP polls](http://www.realclearpolitics.com/epolls/latest_polls/)-- he is often down by 15 to 30+ points across the south, and only has a chance in a few states. Not to mention Clinton's major advantage with superdelegates. I honestly don't see any likely scenario where he can snag the nomination.\n\nChange my view!

            "selftext": "In four primaries, Sanders has only managed to win one, which was in a very white state adjecent to his own. Otherwise, Sanders has lost both Iowa and Nevada, and is going to lose South Carolina today. Coming very close in Iowa and making rapid gains in Nevada is meaningless if he can't actually demonstrate that he can win states. Repeatedly I've seen the blame placed at low voter turnout and millennials (who overwhelmingly support Sanders) not showing up, but there's no reason to expect that that will change in future primaries, or during the general election. Sanders simply isn't stirring up the same numbers that Obama did in 2008, and the groups that favor him just aren't reliable.\n\nIf Sanders can't even manage to beat Hillary Clinton, there's little reason for me to believe he can beat a Republican in the general election. Electability polls are notoriously unreliable, and aren't a good metric to go by. If Sanders can easily sweep every Republican candidate, why isn't that translating to the here and now in defeating Hillary?\n\nFortunately, my primary is one of the last ones (PA), so I have plenty of time to change my opinion, but as a voter who is more concerned with keeping a GOP candidate out of the White House, electability is the most important factor in looking at Sanders and Clinton, and right now, Clinton looks like the better choice.\n\nCMV.\n\n_____\n\n> *Hello, users of CMV!

            "selftext": "Perhaps the title is a bit hyperbolic, and I am a big supporter of the man so I really do hope my view is changed, but the SC primary tonight, from the perspective of a Sanders supporter, went *very* badly. Contrary to Iowa/NH/NV where he tended to beat the polling averages by something like 5-10%, as of right now with 95% of precincts reporting he seems to have actually lost to for example 538's estimate by almost 3%.\n\nFor a long time Sanders' relationship to the black community has been a big point of contention in regards to his beating Clinton in the primary, and of course Sanders was expected to lose SC, but to lose even more badly than the aggregate predictions seems to indicate in my opinion a failure to accomplish the task of connecting with primary voters from minority communities and convincing them that he will act more in their best interests than Clinton will. There are plenty of possible reasons for this and for the outcome (personally I think to an extent it is a matter of too little to late on this issue to simplify it), but the key takeaway is of course that momentum is huge in these races and Super Tuesday is less than a week away and I have a hard time imagining the news angle really being anything other than \"Sanders gets destroyed in SC\". With that spin on the momentum heading into ST I think a situation that was already teetering on the edge will completely collapse in regards to the outcome of the primaries on March 1. For example, with the current polling he is down by 30% in Texas which awards a whopping 252 delegates, and he is down by almost 25% in Virginia which awards 110 delegates. Georgia awards 116 and he's down even more than 30% there (all according to 538). The only other ST state with that kind of weight is Massachusetts, and even there he is in a dead heat with Clinton.\n\nSorry to all my fellow Sanders supporters but it's looking real bad to me at this point. Is there any data/projections/analyses/etc that can produce a reasonable expectation of further momentum which can actually turn this sinking ship around? I would like to add that no matter what I hope he stays in until the convention, if it goes down like it looks like it will (I was at 65-75% chance for Clinton before tonight and now I'm like 85-90%) I believe he has empowered an important movement and will be a leader in the Senate.\n\nI don't want it to be true, so won't you change my view?!\n\n_____\n\n> *Hello, users of CMV!

            "selftext": "Hello. I'm a pretty big Bernie Sanders fan, but I've come to realize that he probably won't win the nomination. Obama was able to blow pass Clinton thanks to the youth vote and voters of color. Bernie has the youth vote in spades, he's got 85% of it but he doesn't have the black vote which makes up about 40% of key states. Also, young people are shitty with politics, we never vote--if you're old enough to vote, and you don't then ughh.\n\nI don't think Hillary Clinton is a bad person. I think she'd be a better president than Obama and probably would have supported her in 2008 had I been old enough to vote then and had I known what I do now. That being said, I don't think she could win against the Republicans.\n\n1. She's the Republican anti-christ. Obama only has a 46% approval rating, Clinton's approval rating looks pretty similar. The Republicans being the incumbent party have an advantage, and that advantage will only grow if Obama sinks further in the polls. The Republicans will throw everything they got to keep her out of the White House; and attacks on Clinton have largely worked, her approval rating has dropped like a stone since she became Secretary of State. She dropped from 65% approval to 41%. If she were to become the President of the United States she'd be the most unpopular person to win ever. Donald Trump is far less popular, but he has a far more passionate fanbase, that could push him slightly ahead of Clinton.\n\n2. She can't inspire passion. She's winning because she's a part of an entrenched system, because millennials don't vote and the Sanders campaign has failed to engage voters of color. She's not winning because people like her and are excited to see her in the White House. I have zero faith that she'd manage to bring out excitement or loyalty in the voting base come the election season.\n\n3. She's not an amazing debater. She comes across as rehearsed and *always* gives the answer you'd expect. For a politician she's a great speaker, always manages to answer a question without *really* answering it. But when it comes to someone like Trump, someone who is the exact opposite I think she'd do embarrassingly bad. He'd come across as speaking from the heart, speaking passionately and she'd come across as someone reading mental notecards and taking the \"correct\" position her staff told her to take.\n\n4. Political funding is a huge issue in this election. Clinton is funded by wealthy people, she has lots of backing of establishment democrats and large groups (who oddly enough seem to have a personal tie to her campaign, like a son or daughter on her campaign team) but Trump is self funded. It would be so easy to attack her for being in the pocket of the wealthy, and Trump himself has stories about how he used money to influence Clinton in the past. These attacks have worked in the past, and they'd work again against Clinton.\n\n5. The Republicans have the advantage thanks to voter ID laws and being incumbent.\n\nI'd support Clinton in a heartbeat if nominated, but I don't expect to win.\n\n_____\n\n> *Hello, users of CMV!

            "selftext": "This is a proposition that a few months ago I would have thought to be ridiculous. However, the electoral calculus of this election has changed completely, and we are at the precipice of a rare partisan realignment in American history. If Trump and Hill win their respective nominations, Trump has several key advantages that will allow him to dominate over her. \n\n**1. Trump is a moderate republican with populist appeal** \n\nIf Trump even tries to move to the middle to attract support from the anti-establishment left, he will defeat Hill. For the general, he must move to the center and distance himself from his more conservative racist rhetoric. If he does this successfully, he can attract Sanders supporters (not all, obviously). He shares views with Sanders on trade, healthcare (?), campaign finance, iraq war, trade deals, and others. If his campaign focuses on these, he will attract Bernie supporters. Which leads to my second advantage- \n\n**2. Trump will be in full attack mode**\n\nDon's populist stances work perfectly to contrast himself from Hill. Sanders has used a moderate amount of attacks against Hill and gotten a lot of ground. Trump will be merciless, attacking Hill on nearly every front. Here is a hypothetical future Trump monologue taken from [this article](http://www.zerohedge.com/news/2016-02-25/why-hillary-clinton-cannot-beat-donald-trump): \n>\u201cShe lies so much. Everything she says is a lie. I\u2019ve never seen someone who lies so much in my life. Let me tell you three lies she\u2019s told. She made up a story about how she was ducking sniper fire! There was no sniper fire. She made it up! How do you forget a thing like that? She said she was named after Sir Edmund Hillary, the guy who climbed Mount Everest. He hadn\u2019t even climbed it when she was born! Total lie! She lied about the emails, of course, as we all know, and is probably going to be indicted. You know she said there were weapons of mass destruction in Iraq! It was a lie! Thousands of American soldiers are dead because of her. Not only does she lie, her lies kill people. That\u2019s four lies, I said I\u2019d give you three. You can\u2019t even count them. You want to go on PolitiFact, see how many lies she has? It takes you an hour to read them all! In fact, they ask her, she doesn\u2019t even say she hasn\u2019t lied. They asked her straight up, she says she usually tries to tell the truth! Ooooh, she tries! Come on! This is a person, every single word out of her mouth is a lie. Nobody trusts her. Check the polls, nobody trusts her. Yuge liar.\u201d\n\nTrump will utilize the attacks of the Sander's campaign but without any restraint. He will attack her wallstreet connections, demand she release the transcripts, criticize her Iraq war position, her change of heart on trade policy, change of heart on gay marriage, ect. Hillary conventionally should move to the middle during a general election-- this will only attract more anti-establishment left to Trump. Hill will be on the defensive the entire time, she will have to constantly come up with reasons why she won't release her transcripts or defend her ties to financial institutions. Hillary won't be able to level offensive attacks against Trump because he has been far effective at sliding off criticism. Moreover, Hillary's attacks cannot focus on trump's substantive policy positions because those are too popular with Sander's supporters (besides immigration and a few others). She will try and characterize him as a sexist racist, but Trump will respond with criticism of his own that Bernie has stayed away from-- Hillary's sexist remarks to Lewisnky and others, and the use of \"super predator\" to characterize black children. He will attack the Clintons on their mass incarceration/welfare policies which decimated black communities. Which leads to my third point-- \n\n**3. Trump is a far better campaigner than Hillary**\n \nEverything Trump does is calculated. For example, one of the key narratives of his campaign is that there is a constant media bias against him. There is debate as to whether this is actually true, but it certainly fits into the cohesive message of his campaign: the media represents corporations which control politicians which are ALL a part of the establishment. This allows Trump to successfully deflect most criticism against him. Moreover, it attracts supporters from another candidate who has been the victim of a so-called media bias. Sanders fans, of course, understand the media bias in favor of Hillary. Trump will characterize the establishment in favor of Hillary, thus delegitimizing all attacks that are made against him. Media bias is no longer a negative force against a candidate-- in fact, Trump has found a way to make it work for him. The best example is this KKK endorsement drama. During an interview, Trump didn't clearly condemn the KKK mans endorsement. Immediately after, he disavowed any KKK endorsement at a speech. The media predictably lashes onto the interview statements and portrays Trump as a KKK sympathizer. He says he disavowed that endorsement, and reinforces the huge media bias thats against him, which energizes his supporters. Hillary will have anything but a media bias against her. The media has been constantly on her side, so Trumps attacks will not easily be deflected. Sanders, on the other hand, is a victim of media bias.   _____\n\n**4. Repubs are not as factional as we think**\n\nThe republican base has more energy then it ever has. The voter turnout for all primaries has reached record levels. The democratic turnout, however, is quite low compared to 2008/2012. There is going to be large amounts of voter fatigue from a candidate like Hillary. She has failed to have a strong grassroots movement and has not energized her party. The republicans, although fighting now, will absolutely coalesce around Trump if he wins. The democrats however, will not be as successful. If Trump moves to the center, the desire to vote \"against\" Trump will diminish. This mixed with the fact that people don't really want to vote \"for\" Hillary is serious bad news. \n\n\nThere are definitely more reasons why Trump will defeat Hillary. There are just a handful. So reddit, will conventional wisdom win out, or will the electoral calculus of this election change forever? \n> *Hello, users of CMV! This is a footnote from your moderators.

            "selftext": "There has been a lot of discussion on political subreddits, mostly /r/politics, about Sanders chances to win the nomination. The overall consensus stands that Sanders is hopeful, but not likely to win the nomination. However, I've viewed a disturbing trend among Sanders supporters that manifests itself with a lot of people promising to vote for Donald Trump or another Republican nominee instead of Hillary Clinton in the general election to spite the DNC.\n\nThis is crazy. Bernie Sanders is a progressive, and a staunch liberal. If one is in support of Sanders, then why would they ever vote for a conservative? Every single Republican nominee holds a majority of views that are strictly contradictory to Sanders policies. Whether it be funding government programs, pushing cultural and social programs and movements, tax policies, fiscal and monetary policy, etc. Sanders is opposite to nearly all Republican candidates. Trump may hold the same anti-establishment appeal that Sanders does, but that doesn't mean they are equatable in any way.\n\nClinton, for all her faults, is still a moderate-liberal. Her public policy would be less drastic, but still in the spirit of Sanders public policy. Those who would suddenly support a conservative because they couldn't get their radical liberal candidate, are not liberal or progressive at all. They are simply anti-establishment, and that is not a good thing. It means that they support nothing other than to go against \"the system.\" But there has to be a system of some kind. Wanting to break the political system without offering an alternative or reform is irresponsible and detrimental to American society.\n\nEDIT: So a few individuals have convinced me that there are a few ways in which one could justify voting for Trump if they don't get a Sanders nomination. I'd like also to clarify something. My insinuation within all of this is that it is irresponsible to be anti-establishment at all costs. I still believe that, but there are a few legitimate explanations for why one would vote Republican or Trump if they can't get Sanders.",

            "selftext": "As a former conservative who has changed my views many times over my 40 years, I think that the desire for ideological purity put forward by Bernie supporters is alienating potential voters that could be swayed to vote for either. \n\nWith the introduction of the \"Which Hillary?\" meme, I am feeling more and more shutout of this election cycle. Over time I have changed, and will continue to change my opinions as new data becomes available. This view ,unfortunately, is held in contempt by so many that it almost feels as if \"purity\" is the desired end result. I do not support \"purity\" because it is a utopian ideal that is just not possible in our dirty, scales of gray world. Even this view is held to be one of a \"traitor\", since I do not give unquestioning loyalty to their candidate/viewpoint. \n\nBy promoting this necessary purity, and by holding our pre-change viewpoints against us, it feels as though there is no place in the Bernie camp for moderates. Heck, it's this kind of desire for purity that has caused such a shift in the Republican party that it is almost unrecognizable when compared to its past incarnations. In our modern history, we have been shown what is the eventual end result of the search for purity- collapse and/or violence. The internet has allowed this apocalyptic view to become much more widespread, and the constant talk of a \"necessary revolution\" to be an almost daily declaration. This worries me. This is not what I want in my country. I support disagreement. I am a hypocrite. I am disloyal. I really don't want to be \"purified\".\n\n\nI guess I'm looking for proof of the big tent. I guess I'm looking for some sense of moderation. I want to not be called a flip-flopper. In my view change and evolution encourage growth and acceptance. Long term change just doesn't seem to come from those who don't allow others to change.   \n_____\n\n> *Hello, users of CMV! This is a footnote from your moderators.

But the debate in Texas (after the Nevada results) was just an all out assault on Donald Trump.\nThe strategy of fighting over 2nd place was a bad one - because Trump never crashed. After Nevada, they realized that if Trump ever were going to crash for making an outlandish statement - that would have happened months ago. His loudmouth clown behavior appeals to the angry republican electorate. \n\nTed Cruz is winning decisively in Texas - the largest super Tuesday state. That could give him momentum to beat trump in the future. Also Cruz has some momentum after beating trump in Iowa. Rubio came 3rd, 3rd, 2nd, 2nd, in the early states. That's not a strong foot hold to go into super Tuesday. \n\nRight now it's hard to see a way Trump does not become the republican nominee. But Ted Cruz is really the only one with any semblance of a chance.  Other candidates are just too far behind.  Time is running out - the longer Rubio, Carson and Kasich stay in the race - the larger Trump's lead is going to get. \n\n_____\n\n> *Hello, users of CMV! This is a footnote from your moderators.

Rubio/Cruz will be crushed by Hillary IMO. This doesn't even take into account if he loses nomination and runs 3rd party. That would guarantee a repub loss. So GOP best option is just hope he beats Hillary and hope they can get someone more conservative in there next time.  Otherwise you're basically looking at 12 years w/o republican president and likely 16 with still no real direction for the party. Personally Trump is the only republican I would vote for.",

These people increasingly look at the \"other guy\" (Trump or Sanders) as a 2nd choice for their general election vote.\n\nSo they support Sanders, but if it's Trump vs Clinton they'll vote Trump. Or they support Trump, but if it's Cruz vs Sanders they'll vote for Sanders.\n\nI believe the groups of people who support these two men are not separate camps of people, but rather they create a distinct Venn diagram with significant overlap. I also think this fact will serve to discredit any current polling data should either man receive his party's nomination.\n\nChange my view.\n\n_____\n\n> *Hello, users of CMV!

Polls at this point had McCain and Romney 5 points ahead of Obama and Obama won both of those EASILY. Those results were not close. \n\n**1. Hillary Clinton is battle tested. Bernie Sanders is not.**\nThey'v been throwing attacks at Hillary for 25 years. If they had anything substantive on her, she'd be in jail or retired from politics at this point. There's nothing new you can throw at her. All those attacks have failed. Bernie Sanders has only been elected in Vermont where nearly the entire electorate is very progressive. He's never been tested across the country against the republican attack machine. \n\nHave you seen recent republican debates? They were an all out assault on Donald Trump. Do you think Trump or any other republican is going to play nice with Bernie? We can all agree - the general election is gonna get nasty. They are probably going to make up false dirt to throw at Bernie; Hillary's been taking false dirt for 25 years and she aint dead yet. \n\n**2. Bernie Sanders does not have an attack dog inside him.**\n\nBernie has said multiple times he has never run a negative ad in his whole life. Bernie's \"attacks\" on Hillary have been weak. He has tied her to Wall Street, really that's about it. \n\n You might find his \"lets-stay-positive\" attitude to be inspiring but you cannot win the general election without attacking your opponent. You have to run negative ads - they will be running them against you.  Bernie has not responded very well to Hillary's attacks. She hit him on immigration and gun control and his response was lackluster. \n\n\n\n**3. Hillary as the nominee will turn guaranteed red states blue.**\n Clintons are well loved in the south and the around the Mississippi River. Have a look at [2016 primary results from Georgia, Arkansas, Tennesee, Alabama, Virginia and South Carolina](http://www.cnn.com/specials/politics/super-tuesday-2016). Hillary won and BY HUGE MARGINS. Bernie campaigned very hard in SC and got a 3-to-1 thumping across the South.   \n\n   Take a look at these election results from [1992](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_presidential_election,_1992) and [1996](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_presidential_election,_1996). \nLouisiana, Arkansas, Kentucky, Tennessee, West Virginia, Arizona... These are considered hard red states today but they went blue for Bill Clinton TWICE. Georgia went blue for Clinton once. \nBernie is from Vermont. All of New England is guaranteed blue anyway.\n_____\n\n> *Hello, users of CMV! This is a footnote from your moderators. We'd just like to remind you of a couple of things.

            "selftext": "My one problem with Trump is I am a conservative and I am not even convinced that he is right of center. His previous support of weapons bans, support partial birth abortion, single payer healthcare, and recent support of Obamacare, amnesty, nativist trade policy, and Planned Parenthood makes him seem like a liar and very distasteful to me. He seems 100% right wing rhetoric with leftist policy when it comes to the issues. Hillary seems to be more for the free market and free trade then Trump and will not alienate our allies if she is elected. It actually seems that Hillary Clinton will respect the constitution more than Donald Trump will. They have both relentlessly trampled the 2nd Amendment and states' rights but Trump has also gone as far to attack the 1st Amendment in respect to Muslims and oppositional speech.\n\n_____\n\n> *Hello, users of CMV!

            "selftext": "I should preface this by saying that this election has done nothing for my faith in the American electorate, but that is a separate point.\n\nWhat I mean to get at here is that, for several years now, we have all been hearing (and circlejerking) about how America has become an oligarchy ruled by unassailable special interests, where popular opinion either counts for nothing or can be easily bought.\n\nMy argument is that if this were true, the establishment would not have been able to lose control of this election to the extent that it has. Donald Trump has run roughshod over such establishment figures as Jeb Bush and Marco Rubio on a wave of popular support. Sanders has also gotten more votes than anyone expected.\n\nWhat all this has shown me is that all the media power and entrenched connections of the elite are not enough to stop a genuine wave of popular opinion. Yes, at present that wave of opinion is baying for the blood of foreigners and Muslims. But it is doing so through genuinely democratic channels, against everything the elite has tried to do to stop it. For better or worse, the reigns of power in America are still in the hands of the depressed, enraged, occasionally racist, electorate. Claiming that special interests hold the controlling interest in governance serves only to absolve voters of responsibility.\n\nTo change my view, you'll have to convince me that Trump's support is down to factors other than just anti-establishment sentiment and populism; i.e, show that the forces driving Trump forward are not as democratic as they appear. I'm using Trump as the main example here because it doesn't look at present like Sanders will win against Clinton, so his example doesn't make as strong an argument for the weakness of the establishment's practical control.\n\nWell, there we have it. I think this election has shown that the elites aren't nearly as 'in control' as we think, and that we as voters still hold a greater proportion of power than they do. CMV.\n\nPoint of clarification: I am not arguing that special interests don't hold too much power, merely that they don't hold enough power to be retain control in the face of organized public discontent at the ballot box.\n\n(Note: This post is not in any way, shape, or form, even tangentially, intended as an endosement of Donald Trump.)",

            "selftext": "This was originally posted in r/hillaryclinton but I got 0 responses. So... here I am I guess.\n\nHi guys, I'm not sure where else to post this so I came to her sub! Bernie supporter here who is going to be working my ass off to get him the nomination but let's assume for the sake of this post he doesn't. Hillary v. Trump come November and I cannot for the life of me decide if I will even vote in this election. I'm very active in the political process, I've been voting, donating, and canvassing for 18 years for candidates in local and national elections. I won't get into what I don't like about Hillary because from what I've seen you guys react very negatively to that. Instead let me just tell you what doesn't do it for me and what is important to me.\n**I refuse to vote for a candidate just because the other guy is worse. Full stop.** Please don't argue this point, If I shift towards the party instead of the party shifting towards me my views won't be represented.\n\nThe issues most important to me right now are Campaign finance reform, Military intervention, and Holding people accountable at the highest echelons of government/society.\n\n1. I feel like regarding the issue of finance reform Hillary and I have a lot of common ground but she's never pulled the trigger on actually making the change. And to be frank I think it's because the Clintons have been very very good at pulling this money into the Democratic party. What will make this year different, what encourages Dems this year compared to last to actually stand up and fight to get out from under the thumb of re-election money woes? Especially when they are currently winning that fight against the Republicans?\n\n2. We increased military spending by 800BN under Bush and continued it under Obama. Will Hillary turn this back to a realistic number? This is an absolutely crippling amount of spending that could be spent on our infrastructure and cleaning up the country. In addition Obama's drone strike policies have been absolutely horrifying to me, is Clinton really going to continue this same middle-east policy? How will she differ from Obama? This is the scariest point to me... I honestly can't get over the sheer horror of what we've done and continue to do since 2000 and had hoped we would have changed our stance when we got Obama into office.\n\n3. Accountability for bad actors. This cannot be said enough, we do not hold our bad actors accountable. Hillary's position seems to be pass legislation that allows us to. Historically... this hasn't been the case. We have repeatedly and systematically protected our senators, congressmen, ceos and otherwise affluent people from the actions of their wrongdoing. I work in an industry that is affiliated with the Insurance/Finance industry(Hillary's so called shadow banking) and I routinely see bad actions from our clients that are already breaking existing statues and guidelines. You know what happens when you fail these audits or get caught breaking these laws? You pay a fine. There is already jail time associated with these actions but it's never pursued. It's a cost of doing business in this world, not a risk of jail. No one cares about Frank-Dodd, I don't know if Frank-Dodd is her soundbite or her position but it's 100% toothless if it's her position. It's important to me because from my point of view, there are always going to be bad actors, and unless we follow through with serious jail-time we will continue to behave in the way that makes us the most money at he cost of everyone else.\n\nSorry for the long post, please don't attack my Sanders support or try to convince me that Trump is a scary monster (even if you think he is). I am really just looking for the reasons to vote FOR her in November not against Trump. If that's how I voted I would vote Vermin Supreme over Trump. Appreciate all of the feedback I get and good luck to everyone in November.\n\n_____\n\n> *Hello, users of CMV! This is a footnote from your moderators.

            "selftext": "I'm posting this now because of another post I've seen that really irked me, something along the lines of \"rethink your vote if you're voting based on gender\". I wholeheartedly disagree with this. First of all, how come \"because I'd like to have a beer with him\" or \"because he has a D/R next to his name\" are valid reasons to vote for someone, but saying \"I think it would mean a lot for social progress\" suddenly means you're an ignorant low-information voter. When you say the latter, the immediate response is \"Well did you look at both candidates fairly and equally?\", while with the former it's more like \"I disagree with your reason but it's your right to vote for who you want\". The last time I checked this was a democracy, and in a democracy people don't have to justify who they vote for. \n\nBut even beside all that, let's just look at the idea of a woman voting for a woman over a man. If you are a woman, you've spent your entire life living under leaders who just aren't like you and don't fully understand your problems simply because they are not women. It's not like that makes them inherently bad, but there's an advantage to having an actual woman that does not exist with men. Is it really a radical idea to want to vote for someone who understands your problems like no one else does? \n\nLet me conclude by clearing up a few things. First of all, I'm not a Clinton supporter. I just think it's incredibly condescending and wrong to constantly attack people over the reason they vote for someone, especially when there are much stupider reasons that aren't as aggressively questioned. I'm also not a woman and I don't think Hillary should be elected *just* because she's a woman. But if you've been following even the smallest amount of her campaign, the woman thing is in no way, shape, or form at the center. As for voters, they have the fundamental right to vote for the candidate they think has their best interests at heart, and part of that could very well include the candidate being the only one, and the only one this qualified, to share your gender.",

To my understanding they are someone who does the \"dirty work\" so to speak, exchanging money and selling their power and influence to make legislative changes while getting personally rich in the process. They are, to my understanding somewhat like lawyers, who are paid to represent a certain idea, rather than to protect a client or bring justice, making them theoretically even more corrupt than the often bashed lawyers.\nHillary Clinton is the first public figure that I have seen who is blatantly making millions upon millions of dollars just giving \"speeches\" to special interest groups.\nThat to me sounds like what I imagine a lobbyist is doing secretly behind closed doors. I always imagined that this is how lobbyists get rich, by short speaking fee's but really they are selling their influence and popularity.\nI didn't think that politician could even legally be a lobbyist, as I thought they were supposed to be spending their time working on legislation to help the people of the united states and that would be a conflict of interest.\nIf she makes more money in one half an hour hoorah speech to Goldman Sachs about how blanks shouldn't be \"victim blamed\" for the wars and carnage they reap, than a minimum wage worker could make working 40 hours a week for over 6 years, how does this not make her more of a lobbyist than a legit politician??\nI guess you could change my view by more accurately describing what a lobbyist is, cuz i would love to know.",

            "selftext": "I live in Michigan and our primary is today. You have 5 hours to convince me which one to cast my vote for today. Go!\n\n**EDIT:** Michigan is an Open Primary, so I can vote in either party's primary.\n\nHere are some areas that are important to me. Convince me that your favored candidate best lines up with my views, or that voting for your candidate would do the least damage to the areas I think are most important.\n\n* War: I fall into the non-interventionist camp. I would be in favor of bringing our military home and not being the world's police. I also support Colin Powell's \"You break it, you buy it\" policy on foreign wars. IF we go in, we fix the mess we make.\n* Environment: We need to protect our environment and natural resources, especially water and air.\n* Energy: We need to become more energy independent, even if that means more domestic oil production until cost-effective renewable energy can be developed.\n* Education: Education needs a major revamp. More centralization, less bureaucracy. Common Core is a good thing. More funding needs to go towards education. Teachers should be paid more and/or more teachers should be hired to reduce class sizes.\n* Economy: Free Market is preferred as long as everyone is playing by the rules (ie: some regulations, but not excessive).\n* Taxes: I am middle class and I want lower taxes. I want to have more money from paychecks that I can both save and spend. Spending money empowers the economy.\n* **EDIT:** Corporate Tax: I believe the corporate tax rate needs to be lower to make us more competitive with the rest of the world.\n* National Debt/Spending: I want spending to be reduced so we can take care of the deficits/debt.\n* Immigration: I'm in favor of easier legal immigration. Unless you are native american, you are the product of immigration of some kind.\n* Terrorism: The majority of terrorism we have faced is blowback directly from our policies in the Middle East. We helped create and arm Al-Qaeda and ISIS. We directly inspired the Iranian Revolution and enabled the current state of Iran. We propped up leaders like Saddam Hussein and Gaddafi until they were no longer useful, then collapsed their nations into decades of chaos. We need to get out of the ME and stop intervening in other nation's affairs. Muslim =/= terrorist and anyone who infers that is an unamerican bigot.\n* Entitlements: I like Frank Underwood. \"You are entitled to nothing.\" I also like the idea behind House of Cards' \"AmericaWorks\" program. I think social security and the like are good things, but are broken and need to be fixed (ie: significantly reformed or replaced, not just given more money).\n\nIf there are any other specific views you'd like to know, please ask.\n\nThere you go. Please Change My View.\n\n**EDIT: Result (a bit earlier than I expected, but wife is off work early, so we're voting soon): I'll either vote for Kasich or Sanders. Everyone is distasteful to me and I find these 2 the least distasteful of those left. Kasich has the edge because he is closer to overtaking Trump than Sanders is to overtaking Clinton. I'll decide between the two at the last second at the poll.**\n\n**NOTE: Neither Kasich nor Sanders would likely get my vote in the General Election either way. This is just my way of using my vote to exercise some power into getting the least worst candidate (imo) for the sheeple to vote for in the general (that is said tongue in cheek).**\n_____\n\n> *Hello, users of CMV!

However, in Michigan, Senator Sanders appears to have made significant inroads with minority populations, and it made me realize something significant.\n\n[Here](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/47/Democratic_Party_presidential_primaries_results%2C_2016.svg) is a map of all the Democratic primaries and caucuses held so far in 2016; green denotes a Senator Sanders win, yellow denotes victory for Secretary Clinton.\n\n[Here](https://images.washingtonpost.com/?url=https://img.washingtonpost.com/blogs/the-fix/files/2015/01/S1.gif&op=noop) is a map of the 2012 general election results by state; red denotes statewide victory for Governor Romney, blue denotes statewide victory for President Obama.\n\n**With the exceptions of Iowa, Nevada, Massachusetts and Virginia, all of Secretary Clinton's \"victories\" have been in states that are EXTREMELY unlikely to vote Democratic in the general election based on prior electoral history.**\n\nTo clarify, Secretary Clinton currently has a total of **1221** pledged and superdelegates of the 2,382 needed to win; of these, 465 are superdelegates, leaving a remainder of 745 \"pledged\" delegates based on the percentage of the popular vote Secretary Clinton has won.  Of the 745 pledged delegates, only **103** are the result of wins in non ruby red Republican states - less than **15%**!  In other words, 85% of Secretary Clinton's pledged delegates come from places that will likely contribute absolutely nothing to a Democratic candidate for President when it actually matters in a general election.\n\nBreakdown can be found here, on RCP:\n\nhttp://www.realclearpolitics.com/epolls/2016/president/democratic_delegate_count.html\n\nIf the Clinton campaign believes that certain races and comparisons should be discounted because they do not reflect the broader electorate, what does it say that they are relying on their \"strength\" in voting populations from places that absolutely will not play a role in electing a Democratic President?\n\nIn conclusion, if Secretary Clinton wins the nomination on the basis of \"strength\" in the Deep South - where no Democrat has won on a Presidential level since Jimmy Carter - how is that representative of the Democratic electorate?\n\n**(Please note, I am not saying that Democrats in Deep Southern states do not deserve a voice in this process, I am merely concerned at both the double standard implied by the Clinton campaign and the outsize role the South appears to be playing in the selection of the Democratic nominee.)**\n\nPlease, show me why this A. isn't hypocritcal on the part of the Clinton campaign and/or B. how the South playing a major if not decisive role in selecting the Democratic nominee is not ultimately harmful to the will of voters in states that actually elect Democrats.\n_____\n\n> *Hello, users of CMV!

I'd identify as an Independent if it wasn't meaningless with the current system. So I identify as nothing. I vote and support both Democrats and Republics. I support Senator Sanders and he's my top choice out of all of the current candidates. I don't consider myself an adamant supporter of his views. I don't know enough about healthcare systems to have a significant view on the best way to deal with healthcare, so I have no positive or negative opinions about his healthcare policies. I dislike his views on space and energy. His views and policies as President make their primary impact through bills he can influence and push through congress. So ultimately his personal views don't mean that much if they can only be drafted by a congressman. I primarily like him because of his honestly and integrity -- he seems genuine. \n\nThis gets to the interesting bit. I have a lot of trouble trusting Clinton. I agree with more of her political views than I do Sanders, but she feels very dishonest. I trust Trump more than her. Yes, he's insensitive and blunt, but many of his views are fairly moderate. With Trump it's the same case as Sanders: his more extreme ideas still have to make it though a Congress. At least having Trump as president will help to shake up the atmosphere of the Presidency. I like the idea of non-politicians holding elected office and Trump could serve to set the precedent of entrepreneurs in office. However, I feel dirty thinking that in the hypothetical event that it was a Clinton v Trump ticket, I would vote for Trump.\n\n_____\n\n> *Hello, users of CMV!

Likewise, since the 80s Hispanics have voted more than 2 to 1 for the democratic party, even when candidates such as Reagan and George H Bush signed or proposed amnesty laws. I think we are at the point that republicans are synonymous with evil to minorities, and there is literally nothing they could possibly do to win over the minority vote, and any proposals they did make would be assumed to be insincere, and any minorities who are a part of the republican party are considered race traitors. I think that because of this, the party needs to simply dissolve. Moderate members should join the democratic party and over time a centrist wing will break off from the democratic party while the democrats will become farther left (socialist left headed by Sanders type people). \n\nso to CMV, find me an example (state or federal level) where majority of blacks + Hispanics voted for a republican candidate (where the democratic challenger wasn't totally incompetent or a criminal), or tell me why the republicans wouldn't be better off forming a new party and how they could possibly win over minorities. \n\nsources:\nhttp://latinovotematters.org/stats/\nhttp://www.factcheck.org/2008/04/blacks-and-the-democratic-party/\n\nhispanics:\n\n    1980 Jimmy Carter, 56% Ronald Reagan, 35% +21\n    1984 Walter Mondale, 61% Ronald Reagan, 37% +24\n    1988 Michael Dukakis, 69% George H.W.

(I believe abortion rights would be mitigated by private donations to help women travel to abortion clinics). https://fundabortionnow.org/get-help/FAQ\n\nThird downside: I recognize that Bernie Sanders' policies on federal funding of college and single-payer healthcare have large costs and the benefits may be limited. http://www.vox.com/2016/1/20/10793864/sanders-single-payer-vermont http://slatestarcodex.com/2015/06/06/against-tulip-subsidies/ \n\nThe enormous upside: My belief is that because the cost of military adventurism is so enormous, the downsides of Bernie Sanders are overwhelmed by the upside of his restraint in the use of military power.\n\nObama's invasion of Libya was relatively cheap, but the invasion of Iraq was very costly: http://www.cnn.com/2012/10/23/politics/fact-check-libya-cost/\n\nHillary Clinton or a Republican would have invaded Libya harder (and more expensively): http://www.vox.com/2016/2/29/11134492/obama-clinton-libya-lessons \nHillary Clinton or a Republican would be likely to invade more countries (for example Syria) http://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2016/04/the-obama-doctrine/471525/\n\nIn summary: Bernie Sanders' programs may cause hundreds of billions of dollars of damage to the economy with free college, single-payer healthcare and anti-free trade, but military adventurism involves trillions of dollars of damage to the economy.\n\nIs there anything I'm missing here that I should take into account?",

            "selftext": "Disclaimer: this is not meant as a semi-veiled attack at Hillary Clinton, though it may certainly apply.\n\n_____\n\nOften, we hear about politicians \"evolving\" on issues, which is really just a code word for \"changing their mind.\" They may be against abortion or capital punishment or gay marriage at one point, and be convinced of the opposing point of view at a later one.\n\nBy itself, changing your mind is not a problem. I respect people who can consider other points of view and adjust their own views accordingly.\n\nHowever, the purpose of a political candidate is to be a proxy for their voters' opinions. When you vote for a political candidate, you are (ideally) aware of their issue positions and feel like they best represent you. You make the informed decision that electing that candidate is the best way to advance your personal political agenda.\n\nWhen politicians evolve on issues, they may no longer represent the opinions of those who elected them. That, in turn, defeats the purpose of electing them to begin with. In a representative democracy, a politician supposedly represents the views of those who elected them. The mechanism for change isn't changing your mind, it's electing a new candidate.\n\nBy changing their views on important issues, politicians may in effect be saying that they don't care so much about representing a particular set of views as they do about being elected again. But even if you remove that bit of cynicism, it's simply risky to vote for a politician that may change their view (for whatever reason, good or bad), because they may not represent you properly.\n\n**TL;DR**: people changing their views is admirable. Politicians changing their positions is bad for representative democracy.\n\n_____\n\nEdit: I'm heading out to watch the Sounders game, but I'll try to get some more debating in during halftime. I'll certainly respond to everybody who comments after the game is over.\n\n_____\n\n> *Hello, users of CMV! This is a footnote from your moderators.

It was certainly pretty dumb for her to run her own mailserver, and her mistake definitely risked the security of whatever information was sent on that server.\n\nWith that being said, it is not unusual for the government to screw up technologically, sometimes to a stunning degree. Just a few months ago, the **director of the CIA** had his **AOL email account** hacked by [teenager](http://nypost.com/2015/10/27/cia-director-outraged-with-teenager-who-hacked-him/).  Obamacare was almost dead in the water because of a poorly-designed website.\n\nWhy should we think that her personal mailserver was anything other than a technical error? What evidence is there that this was at all malicious? \n\nI am not the biggest Clinton fan --- I'll be voting Bernie in the primary --- but I think that \"emailgate\" is essentially the same kind of Republican obstructionist propoganda that \"benghazigate\" was. It has unfortunately been picked up outside of the right wing media because Sanders supporters, etc, have an incentive to attack her.\n\nCMV.\n\n_____\n\n> *Hello, users of CMV!

            "selftext": "First, let me provide a little bit of context as to where this thought comes from. I am a Bernie supporter, and while I'm still holding out hope, I recognize the likelihood that Hillary Clinton will be the democratic nominee. Meanwhile, Trump is rising seemingly by the day over on the Republican end. Now, this could only be a regional thing, though I've seen the sentiment echoed online as well--but many, many people who I interact with on a day to day basis see Trump as an unfortunate \"lesser of two evils\" in a matchup against Hilary. I don't share this view, but I've been hearing it in just about every discussion I've had pertaining to the election lately. \"It can't be worse than Trump unless it's Hillary,\" \"I'd only vote Trump if it came down to him and Hillary,\" etc. This notion terrifies me, but it does lead me to another point: Trump is not the Republican favorite of any of these people, either. Nearly every republican I know supports Ted Cruz, who looks to be rapidly approaching the status of Trump's only contender for the nomination. \n\nAt first, I wanted to root for Cruz getting the Republican nomination. While I knew that he wasn't an ideal choice, I assumed that he would be a safer alternative than the Donald. But then I looked into his platform, and now I'm not so sure.\n\nA few points that stood out to me:\n-Ending corporate income tax\n-Denying subsidies for producers of renewable energy \n-His immigration policy is basically \"Trump with less shouting.\"\n-Against net neutrality\n-Stances on social issues are a nightmare \n-The same ridiculous \"flat tax\" that everyone ripped on Carsen for \n-Opposed to protections on ocean, coastal and Great Lakes ecosystems \n-Everything regarding the Middle East. \n\nI could go on and on, but you get the point: pretty typical far-right fare. However, Cruz takes it a step further with fanatical religious rhetoric akin to people like Huckabee and Santorum. Cruz religiously fueled manifest-destiny attitude terrifies me--we have a separation of church and state for a reason, and fanaticism combined with power is, historically, not awesome. I feel that it Trump weren't in this race, then Cruz would be the one everyone considered a crazy extremist. Trump's outlandishness has had a ripple effect of making other extremists look moderate by comparison.\n\nWhich brings us to the tip of all this: the Cruz vs. Trump argument. Yes, Trump's rhetoric is just as backwards and insane as Cruz's, often worse, but the key difference is that Trump doesn't seem to have any ACTUAL plans. His entire \"platform\" is reliant on buzzwords, blanket statements, and pandering to his base--no substance, no actual plans or policies, which, in any other case, is a bad thing. But Cruz seems to HAVE plans. He knows what he's going to do and has at least some idea of how he'll do it. And I don't think that anything good could come of that.\n\nTrump, meanwhile, has no idea what he's doing. He's politically and economically incompetent, and likely would struggle to make anything happen legislatively speaking. In addition, he has a rather wishy-washy history, certainly none of the hardline convictions that drive Cruz. While I've hesitated to make these sorts of statements about Trump up until now, the fact is that we still can't be entirely certain WHAT he believes, as a whole. There are grey areas, though at the very least I can agree with some of the stances he seems to have held in the past. And he feeds off of his popularity right now, but celebrity is fickle--he doesn't have the same unshakable \"moral\" convictions that drive Ted Cruz. While I hold no illusions that Donald Trump would be easy for anyone to work with, his \"convictions,\" if you can even call them that, stem from a much more transient, negotiable place than Cruz's fire-and-brimstone religious extremism.\n\nWhat it boils down to is that, under a Donald Trump presidency, there is some ambiguity as to what might happen. But we can KNOW that a Ted Cruz presidency would be disastrous. \n\nSo, people of Reddit, change my view. ",

            "selftext": "In head to head polls for Trump vs Sanders and Trump vs Clinton, Trump loses. Many republicans have started/follow the NeverTrump cause and claim they'll leave the party rather than vote for him in a national election. As someone who views Republicans and Democrats as two sides of the same coin, I think the best thing for 3rd party candidates would be for a Trump nomination.  Trump is probably the best thing that could happen to third party candidates since the death of the Whig party.  \n\nAs a bit of clarification, I'm **not** looking to debate the following\n\n* How my analogy to Whigs is bad or if something else may have been a better example of the best thing happening to a third party.\n\n* How awful it would be if Trump wins.\n\n* How it isn't good for democrats to do this.  I don't care about them for the purpose of this CMV.\n\n* How it may be futile to do so.  In other words if your argument is that it'll only get the 3rd party votes from 2% to 5% then there's no point for you to argue.  I'm only interested if you think Trump winning the GOP nomination makes the 3rd party votes go down.\n\n\n\nIn summary my view is simply that independents should vote for Trump in the primary because it will drive many Republicans to third party candidates.\n_____\n\n> *Hello, users of CMV!

            "selftext": "I will admit, in this election I was very much in favor of Bernie, but his chances look pretty well shot at this point. And in the primaries on the Republican side, Trump is honestly looking like the front-runner.\n\nI think that the reasons that I can't vote for Trump are obvious. I will fully admit that I wrote him in during the 2008 elections because that was another presidential race where I didn't like either candidate and Trump had yet to prove (to me) what a colossally bad choice he would be.\n\nI still have beef with Hillary Clinton over her whole \"Videogames are making this country violent\" thing from the 90s and 2000s. Something so obviously wrong and something that was basically a crusade started by professional lunatic and vexatious litigant Jack Thompson, I just can't forgive that, despite the parts of her policy I agree with.\n\nI considered moving to Canada, but upon further reflection I would have to mock myself so hard I'd burst into flames if I did this.\n\nSo the only option left is to try to shake things up in the American political system. [5 percent of the popular vote qualifies a third party for a government grant that will put them on somewhat-equal financial footing with the big 2](http://ivn.us/2012/11/01/why-5-matters-to-gary-johnson/) and come next election cycle it's going to be much *more* interesting.\n\nI say Libertarian because I agree with them the most on social issues; I've drifted away from them on economic policy, but I do think that many of their social policies (ie: stop imprisoning non-violent drug users and let the ones who are currently in jail free) will help the economy, so that mitigates things.\n\nSome things that probably won't change my view:\n\n* Challenging my currently-held political beliefs that make me think Libertarians are my best bet (I agree with Libertarians almost entirely when it comes to social issues, but align more Democrat for economic issues)\n\n* Trying to convince me that Trump or Hilary aren't that bad. I know that I agree with Hilary's stances on a lot of things, but I still don't trust her at all, and that's important. I don't agree with Trump on anything.\n\nSome things that might be the best avenue for a view change:\n\n* A different third party who has a chance at getting 5% and aligns more closely with my views.\n\nAs a quick rundown on social issues: I believe that people should be free to do what they want up until it infringes on the rights of others directly. I believe that victimless crimes should not be crimes. I believe that there's no reason that gays should not be able to both marry, and be able to carry a firearm, just so I get in something that gets both sides riled up.\n\nOn economic issues: I believe that wealth inequality needs to be addressed, and the free market fails to do this. I believe that once something has become both 1) ubiquitous enough and 2) a necessity for modern life, it should be made a public service or utility (healthcare, internet, etc;). I believe that the government should exist to make sure that companies and other people don't infringe on the rights of others, with bad business practices and the like.\n_____\n\n> *Hello, users of CMV!

            "selftext": "Both Clinton and Trump seem like bad people to vote for when it comes to being the President of the United States.\n\nHillary seems like a corporate pawn. She's taken so much money from all sorts of places, it's hard to believe she wouldn't have their interests in mind. I can't get behind that. Also, the way she talks and acts seems very like, \"I'll say and do anything if it means getting elected.\" I think she tries really hard to be perceived as cool or something. When I listen to her talk there's just something very disingenuous about it. I'm not even sure I can trust her stances on most things. To me, she's just not likable or trustworthy at all.\n\nTrump seems like an all around terrible person. The way he talks and acts doesn't seems like the way a President should talk and act. His immigration policies seem extreme. I think he has Trump's interests in mind first over the country's. Also, since Trump is a business mogul, would he really just walk away from everything to be President? I'm pretty sure he'd be dividing his time between his empire and his presidency, which doesn't seem like a good thing.\n\nI can't find any good reason to vote for either of these people.\n_____\n\n> *Hello, users of CMV!

            "selftext": "I have been a Bernie supporter for some time now. Unfortunately Bernie Sanders has not been able to convince enough people that he should be the presidential candidate for the Democrats. Especially after last night it is looking more and more unlikely that Bernie Sanders can win the nomination. I absolutely do not want a Republican to take the White House in 2016. Hillary Clinton is the Democrat nominee and holds many similar views to Bernie and I view her as a viable candidate for my vote. The further the primary season is stretched out, the more needless money is spent by Bernie and more importantly Hillary for these elections. I think it would be in the best interest of the Democratic party to \"finish off\" Bernie and allow Hillary Clinton to save her war chest for the upcoming November election. I vote in Wisconsin for the Democratic Primary on April 5th. \n\nThings that will change my mind:\n\n*  Convincing me how the extension of a losing campaign will help the Democrats win the White House\n\n*  Convincing me that somehow Bernie can rebound and win nearly 60% of the delegates in all upcoming states.\n\n*  I might be wrong on the transferability of money, i.e. that the money from the primary campaigns cannot be used on the general election. I am unaware if this can be done or not.\n\nThings that won't convince me:\n\n*  Quibbling over Bernie Sanders being better than Hillary Clinton on issues x, y, or z. Both Hillary and Bernie are better than the three Republican candidates left in the race, and I'm more concerned over who has the White House come January 2017.\n\n*  \"Just don't vote.\" Other elections, specifically the Wisconsin Supreme Court election takes place that day, and I am more voting for that than the Democrat primary.\n\n* \"Wisconsin has an open primary, vote for a weak Republican instead to cause the GOP nomination to go to the convention.\" This just seems really petty to me, and dishonest when I identify as a Democrat and not a Republican.\n_____\n\n> *Hello, users of CMV!

            "selftext": "Why does person A decide to pursue a platonic or sexual relationship with person B? Usually because person B has a set of qualities that person A finds desirable. Opposite of that is the set of hypothetical qualities of person B that would be most beneficial to person A in a relationship.\n\nThe main reason for why platonic or sexual relationships might end up having more negative than positive consequences for the individual is a lack of correlation between desired and beneficial qualities, which in the majority of the cases is due to \n\n* mistakenly identifying non-beneficial qualities as relevant and beneficial and therefore desirable, or\n\n* mistakenly identifying beneficial qualities as irrelevant or non-beneficial and therefore non-desirable.\n\nFrom my point of view some examples of the former are physical appearance, wealth (past a given point), propensity for violence and of the latter tranquility, reliability, compassion.\n\nI don't count qualities like trustworthiness or selfishness directly since no one would define them as undesirable or desirable respectively. The importance here is that some other qualities might have implications on these qualities that a person might disregard; a lack of reliability can also be a sign of a lack of trustworthiness, a lack of compassion is a sign of selfishness.\n\nSome empirical evidence that supports my view:\n\n* [40-50% of all first marriages](http://www.divorce.usu.edu/files/uploads/lesson3.pdf) in the US will end in a divorce. The reason in almost all cases is the fact that at least one partner misidentified the qualities of the other partner, whether it is the amount of commitment, selflessness, fidelity, maturity or anything else.\n\n* [4/5 of rapes in the US](https://rainn.org/statistics) are committed by someone known to the victim, 47% are committed by a friend or acquaintance. (I want to make *explicitly clear* that I am **not** putting a generic moral responsibility on the victim. See note at the bottom.) A person who will commit a rape-crime can only gain the friendship of the victim if she mistakenly identifies him as trustworthy.\n\n* Misreading the personality of politicians: [The latest poll](https://today.yougov.com/news/2016/03/14/trump-rises-national-support-rubio-falls-and-carso/) shows that Trump has an approval rating of more than 50% compared to Cruz, Kasich and Rubio. On the other side, [Clinton](http://edition.cnn.com/election/primaries/parties/democrat) now has roughly twice as much delegates as Sanders and will likely end up the democratic nominee. If I didn't know either of them and listened to their supporters talking about the other candidate, I'd think that both of them are mad-ass villains trying to destroy the US. Now, both sides can't be right, which means at least one side is grossly misidentifying a political candidate to have qualities beneficial or detrimental to the US.\n\nI believe that it is not a Herculean task to correctly identify the qualities of a person with respect to a possible platonic or sexual relationship (or an election for that matter), after spending some time with him/ her. So far I never had major problems with trusting or investing in the wrong people, and I plan to keep it that way. I also believe that in many cases a misidentification of a quality can be prevented by focusing less on how much short-term profit a relationship with a person having that quality would have on my own life.\n\n**About victim blaming** (if you care to read this): A girl in her 20s who I know well has been going through a hard time for a couple of years now, and last year started sending a very questionable man in his 40s nude pictures of herself in exchange for cigarettes, money and attention. It was very evident that being around him was not a good idea, even dangerous, which I told her, but she disregarded it. Earlier this year I found out that in her own words she had been drugged while at his place and sexually assaulted and raped. I am giving this example to show that in some cases the victim *does* have a part of the responsibility for what happened, namely she could have prevented it, if she had better identified him as the actual devious criminal person he is. To clarify this: I do not generalize *all* or even a majority of the victims of a rape crime to be even similar to this case, but I don't exclude the possibility that a given case *is* similar. As for the perpetrator: He should be prosecuted no matter what the victim did before. A rape is still a rape and should be treated as such.\n\n_____\n\n> *Hello, users of CMV!

            "selftext": "I'm a Sanders supporter who would vote for Stein or the Socialist Party USA in the event of a Hillary nomination. This may or may not make a factor in your arguments, but I live in Texas, which is not a swing state. With that said, there are many times Hillary supporters who try to gaslight Sanders supporters into trying to vote for her because Trump would be much more horrible.\n\nThis is my concession: Hillary would be better at domestic policy than Trump. Although I don't think Trump would be able to get most of what he wants done, simply by the virtue of our legal and legislative system not being accommodating (things like banning Muslims from the United States.) *But*, for the sake of argument, and just looking at their proposals, Hillary would be better than Trump.\n\nMy argument: On the other hand, whereas Hillary would be better than Trump domestically, she'd be a nightmare in the foreign policy arena, much to the point where the domestic benefits of voting for her, against Trump, would be cancelled out, because Trump does not have as hawkish of a foreign policy and would incur a dramatically smaller amount of dead people and chaotic situations overseas.\n\nI'll recognize that if you inherently value an American life more than a non-American, then Hillary is a better choice. I do not feel the same way; I think all life is equal and should be given equal consideration, and this much is not up for debate for me. However, I'd like to see if my view can be changed within the parameters I've laid out.\n\nMy evidence/furtherance of my argument is this:\n\nWhere Donald would be a nightmare domestically, and Hillary would be better, it balances out in the fact that many more people would die under Hillary's administration overseas. For the proof of this, you only have to look at her policy, while she was at State, toward Haiti and Honduras. Haiti is still a hellhole, in part, [because of Hillary's policy toward them](http://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2015/09/hillary-clinton-email-213110), and, as well as that, she helped institutionlize the coup in [Honduras](http://fpif.org/murder-exposed-hillary-clintons-grim-legacy-honduras/), which helped create a humanitarian crisis in the form of child refugees flooding the United States, which she defended [sending back to the country](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/06/18/hillary-clinton-immigration_n_5507630.html) and in which, after that decision, some were [murdered](http://thinkprogress.org/immigration/2014/08/19/3472301/five-children-killed-after-deportation-honduras/). As well as that, people are fairly sure that the military regime she supported are the ones who killed [Berta Caceres](http://www.thenation.com/article/the-clinton-backed-honduran-regime-is-picking-off-indigenous-leaders/). She basically resurrected Reagan's ghost for her time at State.\n\nThat's not even mentioning the fact that she supported the Iraq war, and didn't issue a mea culpa until it was politically necessary in 2007. More over, she was the lead person in the Obama administration toward the policy of overthrowing Gaddafi; and in the case toward Libya, [she resorted to Bush-style tactics in justifying it](https://newrepublic.com/article/121879/hillary-clinton-should-take-blame-disastrous-libyan-intervention). Libya is now a shithole run over by radical Islamists with no hope to recover, and with the body count racking up day-after-day. Her stated policy in Syria is a no-fly zone, which she says would require no ground troops, but the Joint Chiefs of Staff disagree... saying it would [require 70k troops, would require $1bn a month](http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2013-07-22/dempsey-says-syria-no-fly-zone-could-cost-1-billion-a-month), and that was before Russia was getting involved. Now that Russia is involved, it may start a direct war with Russia, in addition to needing more American ground troops in Syria, launching us into yet another Iraq-like war.\n\nAnd, finally, she has saber rattled toward the Iranians, counting them as being proud enemies of hers, and [has not hesitated to say that military force would be used against them under her administration](http://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-politics-iran-idUSN2224332720080422) if they could find a pretext to do it.\n\nThis is all contrasted with Trump's shitty foreign policy, which is more or less limited to Syria, where he says that we will target terrorist's families, so on and so forth. But most of his foreign policy rests upon using sanctions and revoking trade deals. He's one of the few Republicans to say that he wouldn't rip up the nuclear deal with Iran, that he would use sanctions instead of military action, if they step out of line. And that he would use the Chinese trade imbalance to deal with them \"devaluing their currency.\" Which is not a good way to go about these things, but at the very least, the only militarized policy he has, as far as I can tell, is toward Syria, the same as all the other candidates, and would assuredly leave less of a body count across the world as compared to Hillary's whole earth strategy.\n\nSo, if we take the principle seriously, that American lives are just as important as lives overseas, it would appear to me that, in a \"harm reduction\" situation, there is no good option. No harm is reduced by having either of them in office, for different reasons. Trump and Hillary are both extremely harmful in different ways; except one would do more harm here and the other would do more harm overseas. If both things are priorities -- and to me they are -- then it seems like Hillary v. Trump is a wash.\n\nLook forward to the replies!\n\nEDIT 2: I realize this is a contentious argument for some, but I'd appreciate if you (the royal \"you\") actually mounted counter-arguments and... you know... tried changing my view instead of downvoting.\n_____\n\n> *Hello, users of CMV!

            "selftext": "The crux of my argument is this: **The Iraq War was the most racist act by the US government in my lifetime.**\n\nLet me start with a bit about myself.  I'm a second-generation immigrant man of color living in the US Midwest.  I am a progressive atheist, so I'm not interested in arguments from religious, men's rights, or white rights points of view.  I am not planning to vote for either Trump or Clinton. \n\nThe death toll of the Iraq War, beginning with George W. Bush's invasion, ranges from [several](http://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736%2806%2969491-9/abstract) [hundred thousand](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/10/15/iraq-death-toll_n_4102855.html) to [more](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/robert-naiman/how-many-iraqis-did-we-li_b_673683.html) [than](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ORB_survey_of_Iraq_War_casualties) [a million](http://www.justforeignpolicy.org/iraq).  To put it in perspective, that's:\n\n1. more deaths than were caused by both nuclear bombs we dropped on Japan;\n\n1. about as many deaths as the Rwandan genocide;\n\n1. a tenth as many deaths as the Holocaust.\n\n\nProgressives say that racism is the combination of prejudice and power.  That is, racism is measured by results, not by depth of feelings.  Measured by deaths, the Iraq War seems to me more racist than anything the US has done since the Vietnam War.  Its rationale was also bigoted to the core.  When we strip away all the tortured confessions and the propaganda about nukes, what's left is the claim that Saddam Hussein was a brown Muslim just like bin Laden.  Asked about the Iraq invasion during the 2004 debates, Bush claimed [\"the enemy attacked us,\"](http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/politics/debatereferee/debate_0930.html) which only makes sense if Hussein and bin Laden are lumped together.\n\nHillary Clinton voted for the war.  Moreover, as a leader of the opposition party, she gave ideological cover to other Democratic senators who were on the fence about it.  Even now she is unrepentant about her war vote, and she's [palling around with the terrorist Henry Kissinger](http://www.thenation.com/article/henry-kissinger-hillary-clintons-tutor-in-war-and-peace/) whose wars in Asia were even more deadly than hers.  This suggests to me that she is likely to launch [another war](https://www.rt.com/news/332022-assange-clinton-vote-war/) against a developing country if she is elected. Donald Trump, on the other hand, was ambivalent about the war before it started and [turned against it](http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2016/02/20/fact-check-donald-trump-iraq-war/80657524/) several months afterwards.  \n\nTo me, **this difference outweighs all acts of racism by Trump.**  If you disagree, I'd appreciate arguments using numbers and not just words.  How many deaths were caused or would be caused by Trump's racism?  \n\n\n###Counterarguments\nto my argument, ranked from strongest to weakest (in my opinion):\n\n**A** *The devil you know is better than the one you don't.  Sure, Clinton might start a war against a relatively weak country and kill another million people of color, but Trump might start wars against China or Mexico, killing many millions.*\n\nThis is the strongest argument simply because Trump has never held high-level elected office, so we have no idea how he will function in that role.  The Republican Party (and, I'm sure, the Democratic Party) has ways of cracking even the bravest people.  Look at John McCain, maverick war hero, who was made to pick Sarah Palin as his running mate, to accept the 2006 Military Commissions Act letting US torturers off the hook, and to stand by as the Roberts Supreme Court eviscerated his McCain-Feingold campaign finance law.  \n\nThe establishments of both parties want the option of war, and Hillary Clinton is at least as likely to support it.  I don't see Trump trying to enter a bigger war of his own accord.  His distrust of other nations takes the forms of isolationism and protectionism, rather than imperialism; his definition of success seems to be keeping US money here at home, rather than controlling foreign territory.  If you've heard Trump say otherwise, I'd love to read about it.\n\n\n**B** *Trump doesn't believe in global warming, which could kill millions of people, mostly people of color in developing countries.*\n\nBut how many people are actually saved by Clinton's belief in global warming, if she doesn't act on it?  She supported the Iraq War, which put more oil on the global market, and she supported (and may still support) fracking and oil export here at home.  Regarding Clinton, [Naomi Klein says \"I don't trust her on climate at all.\"](http://www.alternet.org/election-2016/naomi-klein-takes-down-hillary-clinton-i-dont-trust-her-climate-all-video)  So, what exactly will she do to reduce global warming, and how many lives will she save?  \n\nPart of my problem, I'll admit, is that given Clinton's past actions, I don't trust her enough to learn about what she claims is her position now.  If you believe that she'll make major progress, though, then convince me!\n\n\n**C** *Trump supports the KKK.*\n\nHow many people were killed?\n\nThe total number of lynchings during the most active years of the KKK is estimated at around [5000](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lynching_in_the_United_States).  Most of those were during the late 19th and early 20th centuries, before Trump was born.  So, even if you took the completely absurd position that Trump's refusal immediately to disavow the David Duke endorsement makes him culpable for all of the Klan's murders through its entire history, the Iraq War would still have killed over a hundred times as many people.\n\nI'm not saying that the KKK is not dangerous.  Based on those numbers, it is the most homicidal terrorist group in US history, out-murdering al Qaeda by thousands.  But it still is a terrorist group, and not a military superpower.  If racism is measured by results and not depth of hatred, then an establishment person with a little bit of hatred (such as Clinton) can carry out far more racist killings than a fringe hatemonger.  I just don't see any way that Trump could help the Klan kill even 10000 people, or about a percent of the Iraq War death toll.\n\n\n**D** *The wall is racist, and Trump is racist against Mexicans.*\n\nClaiming that one race is more rapey than everybody else, and that it's responsible for the US's problems, is certainly racist.  But how many people will it kill?  In 2014, there were about [6000](https://www.fbi.gov/about-us/cjis/ucr/hate-crime/2014/home) hate crimes, including 4 murders, 9 rapes, and about 800 aggravated assaults.  Even if we treat rapes and aggravated assaults as equivalent to murders, and even if we imagine that Trump will increase these numbers tenfold, that will still be about 30000 over four years, far fewer than died in the Iraq War.\n\nAs for the wall, it will kill hardly anyone except through construction accidents, and it'll create jobs that stimulate the economy.  I'd gladly take a hundred walls over one more Iraq War.\n\n\n**E** *People in other countries are not our problem, and Clinton would be much better for us at home.*\n\nLet me make an analogy to a neighborhood in which other countries are families living in neighboring houses.  Then there are two things you could possibly mean with the not-our-problem argument.  One is, \"our neighbors have the same rights to life and liberty as us, but that doesn't mean that we have to help them run their households.\"  Sure, but it does mean that we can't kill them.  If we do something that takes their lives into our hands, such as play with matches and light their house on fire, then we don't get to throw up our hands and say they're not our problem.  We, and society, should consider their lives at least as important as ours.  The deaths of those million Iraqis from our war are on us, and especially on those who voted and advocated for it.\n\nThe other thing that could be meant by the not-our-problem argument is that even when we have started a fire that could kill our neighbors, they still aren't our problem; they simply don't have the same right to life that we do.  That argument is so bigoted that it's making my point for me.  Essentially, pro-war Democrats are offering US progressives a Faustian bargain: let establishment corporations kill millions of people of color around the world for profit, and we'll make your lives more peaceful here at home.  There is no way that I can accept this, especially if the Republicans nominate an anti-war candidate, no matter how much else I dislike about him.\n\n\n**tl;dr:** Hillary and [Henry](http://www.thenation.com/article/henry-kissinger-hillary-clintons-tutor-in-war-and-peace/) sitting in a tree, K-I-S-S-I-N-G(er).

            "selftext": "Just to get this out of the way, I support Bernie, for many reasons having nothing to do with this topic, which I only actually looked into today.\n\n(In case you care): there are two powerful reasons that have kept me from caring about this debate before now:  \n1. I've been using \\*n\\*x since childhood and hosted my own email until it became _absurdly_ painful to do so (I'll elucidate as needed). As those knowledgeable on any given subject can attest, journalists and politicians almost always mangle the facts so much that it _hurts_ to see, when you can tell the difference.\n2. I've been turned off to politics for some time now, only barely choking down my cynicism, given the extraordinary circumstances I see around us (example #1: automation), to campaign for Sanders.  So, I had no reason to really care[3], and I followed Bernie's lead, when he said he was sick of hearing about it, until now.\n\nPreemptive arguments:\n\nA: Any 'authorization' may spread the blame, but does not excuse the extraordinary misjudgment.\n\nB: \"I wanted to use one device\"[1]: There are loads of articles about this, but I don't need to read them, to take offense at this statement.  I have a much less sensitive job[2], but this is explicitly against our security policy, and that's not unusual.\n\nC: No evidence of a breach (gist of tons of articles): There often isn't, even when infected by worm or owned by a script kiddie.  In the case of a foreign intelligence agency wanting to set up and listen long term, there's no reason whatsoever to think that they would be detected by even highly competent IT firms, and even if one supposed that whatever firm she used was the very best, (I see mention of two she used _after_ she was out of office, but haven't discovered what firm she used _while_ SecState), it's still an unnecessary increase in attack surface area.\n\nD: I sure as hell don't need Michael Hayden to make my argument for me, but in case you missed it, or want some 'authority':  http://thehill.com/policy/national-security/251451-ex-nsa-director-clinton-email-setup-stupid-and-dangerous\n\n[1] The following youtube video started playing after something else I put on and was listening to in the background.  I heard some interesting quotes, so I paid real attention and began trying to find persuasive counterpoints.  I didn't find any to the points I make above (not that there weren't _invalid_ points in the video); hence this post.  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pW2_onKX5po\n\n[2] You could probably find out where I work, but please don't bring that into this.  Suffice it to say, if you hacked my personal phone or laptop, you (probably!) wouldn't be able to use it to gain access to any of my employer's sensitive information, which, though orders of magnitude less important than the state department's, is still valuable enough that we're regularly spear-phished.\n\n[3] Bernie woke me up to the possibility of our democratic republic still having a pulse, and now I damned well do care, and as much of a fascist-clown Trump is, I tend to think he'll do less damage than an efficient but reckless/selfish member of the establishment in Clinton.  This CMV isn't about changing that view directly, but it would go some of the way, if you earn my delta.\n\nI do have an open mind on the subject, because I distrust any judgment I make ~~after only a couple hours of research, especially when _so_ much has been said~~.  The reason I'm jumping into my first CMV, instead of just continuing my research, is that I strongly suspect that 99% of what has been written on the subject is mangled regurgitation.  I'm not inclined to sift through any more of it; if you have and you think I'm wrong, give me (rinsed) chunks of fact.\n\nedit: escaped some asterisks.\n\n> *Hello, users of CMV!

            "selftext": "So I have the belief that the banks and Wall Street work together with the federal reserve to fund and arm all sides of the war on terror, while making bets on the winners, and investing on who they want the winners to be, the companies that profit from wars (such as weapon dealers and such) and the politicians who will allow them go unregulated like Hillary Clinton. (The big banks have put over 900 million dollars into the Clintons personal bank account in less than a decade) http://www.counterpunch.org/2016/03/16/the-clintons-93-million-romance-with-wall-street-a-catastrophe-for-working-families-african-americans-and-latinos/\n\nSo I think that Obama had ethics, but realized very quickly that he was on a corrupt team of people literally playing with blood money to keep control of the country (somewhat like in the last episode of house of cards season 4, or the beginning of the second Bush term.) Hence him immediately hiring the CEOs of the too big to fail banks into the white house as \"personal advisors\" like some scene from a lord of the rings movie.\n\nBut I think that he is the type of president that would stay up all night trying to make as many less civilian casualties in an unmanned drone attack as possible. Where as Hillary, would be literally paid, to look the other way, and cause as much chaos and civilian casualties as possible, to further the profits of the war on terror. I see our taxes, a remarkable 40% of our poverty income, going mostly to the industrial military complex as a form of the government money laundering, so they don't have to audit the Federal reserve and the big banks and show how much they and their paid offmpoliticians are personally (as in personal bank accounts) are profiting from these wars, that the American people pay for with such a big piece of our hard earned money.\n\nthese sound like wild conspiracist views but these are views that I started adopting at the beginning of the war on terror, that got furthered into my belief system with the housing crisis, and seems to be validified by Bernie Sanders campaign. For example this whole seed planted in my mind when the war on Terror started during the Bush administration. I was dumbfounded by what this war was and so googled \"who profits from the war on terror.\" The biggest most common conspiracy theory at that time in like 2007 was \"banks, the federal reserver, bilderburg and wall street betting on and funding all sides of the war.\"\n\n This is an analysis brought on by common sense and trying to follow the money.\n\n Any evidence against my claims would greatly help my peace of mind, because as of now my plan is to get out of this corrupt, genocide funding terrorist excuse for a democracy and move to Europe. I'll take a broken economy over an evil government any day. I have spent some time in Europe and you can just feel that they care more about peoples physical and mental health so much more. Our government and federal systems are so cold and callous, there's no expectation for compassion or decency or even humanity. But ethnocentrism, that you can find just about anywhere in America, it's definitely part of our culture. I guess all cultures to an extent, but for us to cling to that so stoutly and loudly is just so sad in my point of view.\n",

To me it seems like a GOP holy war on the most likely democratic candidate (Also disclosure: I'm not a huge Clinton fan). What evidence does the GOP think it has on Hillary?

            "selftext": "Ok so \"watch the world burn\" might be a little harsh. It's probably closer to simply hating the status quo so much that eliminating it is more important than anything else.\n\nAs the candidates put out more and more details regarding their policy plans, there's no doubt Donald Trump and Bernie Sanders have almost nothing in common besides their hair issues and a general support for Planned Parenthood. But on the big issues that could have serious impact on the lives of people living in the US - immigration, taxes, foreign policy, gun rights, free speech, health care, higher education, and the overall size and scope of the federal government - they are close to polar opposites. \n\nThere's no way that a person who supports Bernie, but who will vote for Trump, is thinking *\"you know I'd like to have free health care and a path to citizenship for undocumented immigrants, but I'll settle for continuing with the current health care system and deporting all illegals.\"* But last week, The Guardian asked 700 Bernie Sanders supporters who they would vote for if Hillary wins the nomination and 500 of them said they'd seriously consider Trump while only 200 said they'd vote Hillary. (Source: http://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/mar/13/bernie-sanders-supporters-consider-donald-trump-no-hillary-clinton )\n\nThis makes **absolutely** no sense if you consider any of the candidates stances on virtually any issue. So I believe a large percentage of Bernie Sanders supporters don't actually support him for his policies but rather because of what he represents (or rather what he *doesn't* represent). They can't stand the status quo and want to see drastic change more than they want free college or free health care or to see a path to citizenship for undocumented immigrants.\n\nChange my view.\n\n_____\n\n> *Hello, users of CMV!

            "selftext": "My theory: Obama can\u2019t officially endorse Clinton in the primary, because if he does, then Biden will officially endorse Sanders.  Obama knows it would be disastrous for the party to have a president and vice president endorsing opposing candidates in the primary.  What\u2019s more, Obama likely realizes that Biden endorsing Sanders would help Sanders more than Obama endorsing Clinton would help Clinton.  His best bet was to reach an agreement with Biden that both would remain neutral.    \nWhy do I think Biden would endorse Sanders?  Take a look at Biden\u2019s comments from January: \u201cBernie is speaking to a yearning that is deep and real, and he has credibility on it.\u201d  Consider also that Biden decided not to run as it became clear that Sanders was in it for the long haul and would have at least decent odds.  Biden, who was the second poorest member of Congress while he was a Senator, has been a big advocate for campaign finance reform, a big issue for Sanders.  Despite Sanders being described as progressive and Biden as moderate, there are actually a lot of parallels between the views, personalities, and circumstances of the two men.        \nNaturally, one might counter by saying it isn\u2019t unusual for Obama to not officially endorse a candidate, and there need not be some special reason behind it.  The thing is, I checked, and it is, in fact, highly unusual.  When Regan was finishing up his 2nd term, he backed the first President Bush as early as May of 88.  Bill Clinton endorsed Gore \u201cfrom the heart\u201d as early as December 12, 1999.  Bush endorsed McCain in March 5, 2008, saying he would do whatever McCain wanted if it would help McCain win.  In all of these cases, I am talking about official endorsements, with time spent at their side on the campaign trail, not just vague rumors of what may or may not have been said to private donors.   Clinton purports to be running on Obama\u2019s policies, was the most popular member of the executive branch for years during Obama\u2019s administration, and has been considered by many to be the presumptive Democratic nominee (a view I don\u2019t share, but nonetheless commonly held).  And here we are in April, 2016, and still no official endorsement from the white house.  There has to be a reason, and a fear of a divide being created by the acting president and VP backing different candidates would be a plausible explanation.  Not the only explanation, of course, but I think it makes sense.  \n\n_____\n\n> *Hello, users of CMV! This is a footnote from your moderators. We'd just like to remind you of a couple of things.

In *election-only mode*, all CMV posts must be about views relating to either Bernie Sanders or Donald Trump. By stepping up and doing what other subreddits have failed to do - giving users a place on reddit that they can discuss the election - we hope to provide a vital service to our democracy. \n\nIn order to facilitate this change while keeping the tone of discourse that our sub is known for, we will be adding at least 200 new moderators. Please apply in this thread with a link to the cutest puppy picture you can find and a series of haikus about your moderation experience and skills. \n\nTo avoid conflicting with today's theme of CMVLikeIAMA, *election mode* will go into effect starting tomorrow.

            "selftext": "Obama has been a disappointment in this regard, after promising to be the most transparent president.  I believe Hillary will be even worse, because even as she is running for president and apparently trying to get our votes, she doesn't seem to value transparency.\n\nFrom my point of view she has already shown herself to be opaque.  She rarely speaks to the media compared to other candidates, and recent events like pointing white noise at reporters reinforces this.  Last year she went months without taking questions, because she politically calculated she could get away with it.\n\nThe transcripts issue is paramount to my view here.  The Wall Street speeches are an issue, whether you like her or not.  The fact that she has completely blown this off and refuses to give the transcripts makes me wonder how much worse she will be once she is president.  Her reason for not releasing them is ridiculous.  I don't care about Ted Cruz's speeches, I already know he is in the pocket of big business.  I cannot accept this lack of transparency from Clinton.\n\nThe fact that she thinks she can get away with this lack of transparency to voters makes me terrified of what she will do once she isn't accountable in an immediately upcoming election.  Imagine when the issue is drone strikes and foreign policy.  I don't expect she will be more transparent as president.  I think she will continue to be opaque as president because she has shown that she believes she will come out ahead politically by doing so.\n\n_____\n\n> *Hello, users of CMV!

Here are my grievances against The Donald (edit: these don't all have to do with him not being a conservative, but would still need to be addressed in order to convince me that a Trump nomination/presidency would not be a disaster):\n\n\n1. He has, in the past, donated vast amounts of money to several liberal politicians such as Hillary Clinton and Harry Reid.\n\n\n2. His success as a businessman has more to do with the hundreds of dollars of Manhattan real estate he inherited than his personal business ventures.\n\n\n3. His incredibly incendiary and offensive statements towards women, muslims, and hispanics have gone beyond making a statement against political correctness; they are just insulting.\n\n\n4. His entire campaign has run on no substance whatsoever. He makes up his policy as he goes along; and, as we could see from his recent statements on abortion, he just says what he thinks his supporters want to hear.\n\n\n5. Just because he \"thinks he's a conservative\" doesn't mean he is. He said that his sister, an extremely liberal judge, would make a good SCOTUS nominee.\n\n\n6. He has called for protesters at his rallies to be beaten.\n\n\n7. I understand that you're all angry. I'm angry too, and I want to burn the place down. But it's not a good idea to burn a house down *when you're living in it.*\n\n\n8. Last but not least (even though it's number eight, derp) if he is the GOP nominee, he will be the face of conservatism. The damage he will do to the public's perception of conservatives (which has already been heavily damaged by the GOP establishment) may be irreparable.\n\n\nHowever, many people support him; including a personal friend of mine, who is a very intelligent person, and spent a long time deciding who to support. Is it possible that all the Trump supporters know something I don't know?\n\n_____\n\n> *Hello, users of CMV! This is a footnote from your moderators.

            "selftext": "I believe that at the moment the current state of the world will only lead to rough conflicts, the festering of nasty ideologies and breakdowns in communication across all fronts. There are many root causes of this which I will go into further detail on below. Given the way matters have worsened over the last few months, I don't see how we'll ever be able to co-operative with each other on a large scale again.\n\nThe Refugee Crisis and Terrorism.\n\nOver the past few weeks, there has been a lack of willingness across Europe about what to do about the migrant crisis. Most countries simply wish to bury their head in the sand until it goes away. There has been no solid international plan put in place to either end the Syrian conflict, settle the migrants properly allowing them to settle properly in a host country in a way that's controlled and doesn't put too large of a burden on one particular nation, Everyone has seemed to adopt the policy of \"Not in my back yard\". The rise of ISIS and their horrific and deplorable attacks on Paris and Brussels only intensifies their lack of willingness to resolves this issue humanely. Fundamentally there needs to be some form of international co-operation to help these people and quell concerns of terrorism. I may fundamentally and seriously disagree with their views but I still think they have the right to be treated as human beings. \n\nWhich leads to another problem\n\nThe EU\n\nJust because Germany has born the brunt of the refugee crisis by allowing a large amount of refugees in other countries have taken it upon themselves to launch campaigns asking for a referendum to leave the EU. This fuels the agenda of people on the far right groups looking to demonise immigrants and refugees. Using ISIS to further this agenda and capitalise on this for political gain.\n\nDonald Trump\n\nA trend I've noticed as of late is a movement to attack \"political correctness\" to normalise certain morally questionable views and hide behind freedom of speech whenever it's opposed. Trump is thinly veiling his remarks about Mexicans, Muslims as a race and Women a bit to avoid directly conflicting with the First Amendment but it still just doesn't leave a good taste in the mouth. While I am totally for freedom of speech, I am against using it to justify incitement to hatred, violating the rules and morals of institutions and spreading nasty untruths by denying scientific and historic facts like climate change and in some cases ( like on 4chan/pol/) The Holocaust. Trump himself doesn't massively jump over this line but he inspires the behaviour to do it online and in public.  \n\nWhether he intends it or not he has become a beacon for this kind of behaviour. I am equally disappointed in the media for being sordid and relishing in the outrage in search of viewers and not debunking and condemning some of statements that Trump makes, an activity that I admire PolitiFact for. Clinton hasn't done enough to oppose this kind of behaviour and Sanders' fans seem to be adding fuel to the fire of Trump supporters. Both of them seem to be too preoccupied with scuffling amongst themselves in any case. \n\nThe Media\n\nThere are other concerns around media I have and the way they report certain issues such as highlighting nasty attitudes towards Disney for having a Stormtrooper in Star Wars who is black or a female lead character. They want you to be outraged, not saddened or feel a duty to say that it's wrong. \n\nGamergate is also a controversy I have serious issues with.\n\nEverywhere I turn I am disappointed in what we have become and lose hope in what we can achieve as a race. I'm not asking you to agree with me on every point but if you think I'm uninformed, don't see/approach these matters in the right way or have an overly bleak outlook please CMV. \n\n_____\n\n> *Hello, users of CMV!

            "selftext": "My view is based on the principle that the party nomination processes are private affairs.  That is, the party nomination system is strictly an internal process to select the platform and candidates from a party.  The rules are public and can be known and used to the benefit of whoever understands and executes them best.\n\nThis is fundamentally okay with me because I believe it is in any party's best interests (Republican, Democrat, Green, or others) to have candidates and a platform chosen by party members.  The rules allow party leaders to make decisions that they feel are in the best interests of the parties.  It does not make sense to allow people to show up and pick candidates against the party's best interests (as determined by party leaders).  \n\nFor example, the Colorado Republican Party chose not to participate in a primary election, and to instead award delegates based on whatever rules they come up with.  Another example could be where Clinton delegates do not show up to county conventions, and are replaced with Sanders supporters.  In both cases, the rules are known in advance by all potential candidates.  It is up to the candidates to inform their potential delegates, get out the vote, and make sure the enthusiasm is there to secure as many delegates as they can under the rules.  \n\nThis isn't to say I think the process is perfect.  For example, I do not agree with use of local government funds to subsidize the private party nomination process for some parties (Republican and Democrat) and not others (Green, for example).  I am also disappointed that overall our system of government encourages only two private parties, so much that if you don't like the rules of the two major parties, it is very difficult to start your own party.\n\nEDIT: I just realized I didn't actually address super-delegates or unbound/unpledged delegates.  Basically my argument is the same, though.  The party, being a private organization, should be able to enact whatever rules it wants to select its candidates and platform.  If that includes unbound delegates, then that fact should be made widely known to the candidates, and factor into any successful candidate's nomination strategy.\n_____\n\n> *Hello, users of CMV!

            "selftext": "So Hillary Clinton has supported every bomb/war/drone attack that goes through congress, since the beginning of her career. \n\nThe first bomb that I have heard of the Clintons supporting was on the day of Bill Clintons impeachment vote, where he bombed Iraq throughout the day with cruise missiles until he became impeached, and then the bombs stopped. Like a true sociopath (kind of like how he could only \"almost\" apologize to the black lives matter protesters who he accused of being related to gang violence and crack because of the color of their skin) He claimed that the bombs \"achieved our objectives.\" In fact I don't see how a bomb that killed over 50 school children and actually failed it's primary objectives could ever be seen as a success, but you would hope that he and his wife would have learned from that mistake.\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bombing_of_Iraq_(1998)\n\nFast forward to the War on Iraq, which Hillary CLinton supported (which she apologized profusely.) This led to one of the messiest wars in U.S. history, fighting terrorists who use their families as human shields, open fire on U.S soldiers from occupied apartment complexes, to be blown up along with countless other innocent civilians, who become martyrs for more terrorism. There is no accurate number for the number of Iraqui and Afgani civilians lost in this war, but it has been an estimated 1.5 million deaths. ISIS has so far killed about 200,000\n\nNow fast forward to Libya, did Clinton learn from her past mistakes? Of course not she approved of a Forced \"covert\" regime change, and gloriously did her victory cackle when he was killed, and then didn't give a crap when it became a vacuum for terrorists to take over, creating a safe harbor for Isis.\n\nhttp://www.washingtonpost.com/sf/national/2016/02/03/a-tough-call-on-libya-that-still-haunts/\n\nFor the 2008 bombings, the Iraq bombings, the Libya regime change she has used the SAME excuse word for word. \"It was a tough call.\" That's her closest thing to saying \"sorry\" and yet with every new chance to go to war she jumps on it. How can we elect someone like this?\n\nShe blamed the Palestinians for their own civilians getting bombed to pieces!\n\nhttps://electronicintifada.net/blogs/rania-khalek/hillary-clinton-attacks-dead-palestinians-battle-against-bernie-sanders\n\nThe latest information about her unreleased transcripts are that the banks ask her to promote her war hawk history, from her very own mouth!!!\n\nhttp://freebeacon.com/politics/clinton-angrily-refuses-release-wall-street-transcripts/\n\n\nCan someone help my peace of mind so I can take off this tinfoil hat I am beginning to think that our country is 65% brainwashed, that our parents have doomed our country and the rest of the world by allowing incremental politics to kill the idea of an American dream. I am starting to think that it doesn't matter if we have the support, she will rig the election and win at all costs turning our \"democracy\" not just into an \"oglicarchy\" (it already is) but really a \"Monarchy\". Help me please.\n\nEdit: Thanks to Buddiethebears response I can see a more balanced look at HRC and our foreign policy in general. I still don't personally agree with it but I wanted to quiet the insanity that was growing in my head that HRC is pure evil, so now she looks less evil and more typical, thanks dude. She is \"bloodletting\" or \"stirring the pot\" for political gains, and not just personal gains. The view that she personally causes more damage than Isis is changed, in the fact that 3.5 million people have been displaced, meaning that at this rate, there won't be any people left in the Middle East for her/the establishment to blow up.\n",

            "selftext": "In the last debate, Bernie said he would keep his campaign going until the convention if Hillary has not clinched the nomination in pledged delegates. I think that even if it isn't clinched, as long as she has more pledged delegates than he does and more popular vote than he does, he should suspend his campaign and support her.\n\n1. The only way he could win at that point would be if enough superdelegates defect to him to give him the lead. This is entirely undemocratic and it overrides the will of the people. As someone who is running under the guise of being someone who is supported by the people, this would be undemocratic and hypocritical of Bernie.\n\n2. If he does steal the nomination from her by using superdelegates, it would be terrible for party unity against whomever the GOP nominates. Instead of spending the time between the last primaries and the convention consolidating the base and reunifying the party, Bernie will be alienating a huge portion of democrats who are more moderate and don't support his views, as well as Clinton supporters who will feel the nomination was stolen. This is akin to the GOP \"establishment\" stealing the election from Trump in terms of backlash.\n\n3. It's been tradition that despite the superdelegates supporting one candidate throughout primary season, they will end up unifying behind the person who gets the most pledged delegates. In 08, Hillary's superdelegates went to Obama when it was clear he was going to win. For Bernie to do the opposite and try to take superdelegates who support the person who was democratically chosen would be going against the precedent that's been established.\n\nI would also say the same thing about Hillary if Bernie gets the majority of pledged delegates and the popular vote and she used her superdelegates to win. It just seems like that probably won't be the case AND she didn't do that in the past with Obama. ",

The main reason I do not support her (aside from the obvious \"She's a Democrat and I'm a Conservative\" reason) is that she's on the record as supporting multiple gun control proposals and laws that will personally affect me and my ability to buy, possess, keep, collect and use firearms.\n\nProposals like:\n\nRenewing and rendering permanent the now-expired Assault Weapons Ban with the addition of taking out the Grandfather clause that would exempt weapons covered under the ban that were owned prior to it taking effect.\n\nBanning the sale, trade, repair and possession of High Capacity Magazines by non-military and non-law-enforcement consumers without grandfathering currently owned magazines (AKA Civilians).\n\nThe repeal of the Protection of the Lawful Commerce of Arms Act (PLCAA) that protects gunmakers from liability lawsuits that allege that the gunmaker is responsible for the actions of the criminal misuse of one of their products (Mass shootings, crimes, etc.).\n\nShe has also implied at one point that she'd like to see *DC V Heller* overturned. She could theoretically do this by appointing Justices to the US Supreme Court (of course, when vacancies are available) who support Gun Control and would vote to overturn *Heller* if another related case reached them.\n\nAnd a few other policies, but those were the big ones.\n\nAnyway, it is my belief that, if elected, Clinton will make good on her threats and go all out against the 2nd Amendment and do whatever she can do undermine my ability to exercise my rights, pursue my gun shooting/collecting hobbies and my ability to properly defend myself in a life-or-death situation.\n\nI really want to be wrong about this, but I get this feeling that she'll actually ignore all the other issues our country is facing and start attacking the 2nd Amendment the moment she is sworn in (that is, if she wins).\n\nPlease Change My View.

            "selftext": "I hear a lot of leftists who've come out of the woodwork to support Bernie Sanders say that if he's not the nominee they will vote for Jill Stein. Sometimes, I understand, that this is merely a bit of leverage so that Sanders gets a fair shake. Other times, I understand that these folks were already going to vote Green or Stein, and have in the past. Those are not the people I'm talking about.\n\nI'm talking specifically about the people that are defecting from the Democratic Part, the people who wouldn't have voted at all if it weren't for Sanders, and the people who want to use it as a protest vote. Here are my reasons.\n\n1. Although I don't like it, and think it needs to be the first thing to change, we use a First Past the Post electoral system in the general election. This means a two party system will emerge no matter what, and it necessitates tactical voting. Therefore, voting for a left third party spoils the race for the Democrat side. But, you may say, it doesn't matter in solid blue and red states, so what's the harm? Well, it's a matter of trust. If Stein knows this about our electoral system, why would she choose to spoil rather than attempt to change it from inside, like Warren is doing, and like Sanders is attempting this time around? The only answers I can think of are that either she has motives to spoil the Democrats, she is not competent to compete within the parties, or her ego is more important. I'm not saying these things are true, but brainstorming what her reasons might be. On the other hand, if she doesn't know these things about our electoral system, she is not competent to be our leader.\n\n2. The Clinton side is saying that Sanders can't get things done as president. Most of us know that's abjectly false. Sanders has long experience in the legislative process, and people in congress know and like him. But I think that it is absolutely true about Jill Stein. She hasn't been in congress, and everyone there will absolutely see her as an outsider who got there by dumb luck. And they will be right. How is she any of the things that Bernie Sanders is, that the Clinton side is claiming he's not? So, assuming she has a chance in Hell of surviving the general election, what would actually make her a good candidate for president?\n\n3. Now, that said, I'm almost convinced that even though she'd get nothing done, that might be better than Clinton or any of the Republicans getting something done. Because her platform does look good from far away, and she does seem at least to want to go in the correct direction, so at least she would obstruct us from further going in the wrong direction. So if you were thinking of suggesting this in response to my second point, it won't be changing my view. But what I do have my doubts about is that her election would drive the kind of opposition to the establishment that we need to continue under whatever banner Sander's supporters come up with for their continuing revolution in the event that he loses the nomination. How many people would become complacent with her in there? I am open to well-reasoned arguments that her election would inspire further change rather than diffuse energy, but I'm more interested in the first reason I gave, if you want to Change My View.\n\n_____\n\n> *Hello, users of CMV!

            "selftext": "The decision in *Citizens United v. FEC* overturned a federal law \"prohibiting unions, corporations and not-for-profit organizations from broadcasting electioneering communications within 60 days of a general election or 30 days of a primary election\" (source: Wiki sidebar summary).\n\nThe statute that was overturned was disturbingly broad.  As applied in the case, the FEC attempted to prevent an organization from airing television commercials for a movie that it produced criticizing Hillary Clinton, reasoning that the commercials themselves had the same effect as an attack ad on Clinton and thus could not air so close to an election.\n\nI think critics of the decision fall into two groups.  One, the idiots.  These people want \"money out of politics\" and are for whatever reason incapable of imagining the effects of any particular policy.  They might be thrilled to see Bernie Sanders on Saturday Night Live a few days before a primary, promoting his political viewpoint, and actively resist acknowledging the fact that such an appearance would be questionable under the statute overturned by Citizens United.  They understand that handing out political pamphlets to potential voters is possibly the most American thing one can do, and say they don't have a problem with it; but think anything with a production cost over a few thousand dollars is in an entirely different category to political pamphletering.  They think all media is a corrupting influence in politics, but share and share and reshare their candidates words and supportive news articles *while waiting in line to vote*.\n\nThe other group of opponents is aware that overturning Citizens United opens the door to a parade of horribles involving restrictions on speech, and not just in politics; and they expect and desire that result.  Revising the first amendment gets their foot in the door for their pet projects: criminalizing hate speech, restricting other first amendment freedoms like religion and assembly, attacking other parts of the Bill of Rights as outdated, etc.  These people should just move to Europe, in my honest opinion as an ex-European who thinks things are much better here.\n\n~~Sorry, I won't be around to respond for the next few hours, but I will definitely get back to your responses as soon as possible.  Thanks in advance!  Edit: Forgot Rule E.  I'll be here!  Edit 2: I've overdone the ignoring-meatspace thing but I will be back asap and reply to everyone plus follow-ups.~~\n\n_____\n\n> *Hello, users of CMV! This is a footnote from your moderators.

            "selftext": "I hate Trump. I hate his racist remarks, his attitude toward women and the disabled, his cockiness, and his treatment of his fellow candidates. But what I hate more than all of that, is a liar. \n\nI'm an independent who has switched to Democrat to vote for Obama (a decision I deeply regret) and i am a current supporter for Sanders.\n\nLet me put it this way: if my candidate loses to the shadow games, dirty tricks, and big money of Clinton, then I'm done playing nice. Trump, to me, embodies Bernie Sanders' message of no more traditional politics, but in a much more aggressive and violent way.\n\nLincoln may have freed the slaves, but he was still racist in his own right. Jefferson owned slaves of his own. FDR and Trumanand were despicable to Japanese Americans, as well as the victims of Hiroshima. Polk was awful in forcing the Navajo from their home. And then there's the Clintons... whose their crime bill had monumentally horrible repercussions for young African Americans.\n\nMy point is, American Presidents having faults in philosophy and ethics is nothing new. Having these faults lead to catastrophe for one group of people or another is nothing new.\n\nThe difference with Trump is, we know where he stands, and what we would be getting. Also, we know he won't be able to accomplish these things at all. He is up front with his faults and biases, which I think is more than fair. Hillary Clinton, however, is Machiavellian. She has no biases, other than seeing herself in power.  She could pass some other disastrous trade deal that would send jobs over seas. She could Crack down on the war on drugs and bring more harm to young African Americans. She is more of a warhawk than some Republicans, and would cause much worse than Benghazi. But we don't know. We don't know how many groups of people will be in harms way for her to get what she wants. \n\nI could see Trump actually being able to have Muslims register themselves. I could see him bringing back waterboarding and other torturous interrogation techniques. I could even see him building a wall, and having a plan to have Mexico pay for it. We know all this up front. But mass deportation of Illegal immigrants? That will not happen. He would be blocked so quickly it's not even funny. The sheer cost in regards to money and manpower for such a feat is absurd, nobody would agree to it. This is the one thing I see him wanting to do, but not being able to. \n\nWe know what he is up front, and therefore, we know what we can fight him on.\n\nOn the other hand, he's against the TPP, NAFTA, and other trade deals that shipped millions of American jobs over seas. He's a master deal maker, who I think could pay out our debt and bolster the economy immensely, and improve our relationship with China and other manufacturer nations. \n\nHe's also beholden to nobody but himself. His vision of America is his own, not some corporation's. Hillary Clinton has so many different visions of America, it's hard to know which one she wants to actually implement. She also is constantly defending the affordable care act, which I think is convoluted and needs to be replaced. She would be bad for the economy.\n\nI see Trump doing MASSIVE social damage to our nation and it's image. But I also see him doing MASSIVE good for businesses, manufacturing, our debt, and our trade partners.\n\nI see Hillary doing MASSIVE damage in BOTH areas, and yet nobody will be able to see it coming, so we will be completely flanked by her dangerous pragmatism.\n\n\n\nHere's my point.\n\nThe whole world knows what Trump is going to try and do, and so we won't be easily blindsided. We, and everyone else, can combat him on the bad ideas, and reap the benefits of his good ones. Congress and the Supreme Court won't let him get half as far as he wants to go. If you know your enemy, you can defeat him. If you know what your opponent is trying to do, you can anticipate and defend.\n\n Clinton is shrouded in mystery and drowning in corporate influence. She will easily blindside the country with another disastrous bill that will cause tremendous harm. But with Trump, we know what's coming, so we can brace ourselves for impact, and therefore mitigate the damage.\n\nI don't want either one. But I would rather vote for an honest racist who wants to do some good for the country, than a \"progressive\" liar who wants only good for herself. I would rather let a wolf in, than a Wolf in sheep's clothing. \n\nI would rather watch our country burn itself alive honestly, than bury itself under private interests and greed.",

I absolutely think that no matter who wins this race that the two should work together to unify the party either as VPs or in each other's cabinet.\n\nI think usually these debates lead to a whole bunch of linking to opinion pieces and such that I've already read, talking points that I've already heard, and stump speeches that have already been given. To try something new, let's make this a personal discussion rather than a \"show me the evidence\" link fest. If you have to link anything, link Sanders or Clinton's website where they talk about their platform.\n\nTo change my view, state your perosnal reasons for either not voting for Clinton or why you would vote for Sanders. There is 0% chance I will be voting for anyone on the Republican side in primary because it is closed, but I wouldn't vote for any of them in the general either. I will also be voting for whomever is the Democratic nominee regardless of who it is. I will not vote for a third party candidate.\n_____\n\n> *Hello, users of CMV!

Donald Trump is dangerous and would ruin many foreign relationships as well as he just seems pretty inept. Hillary Clinton is too corrupt. She should be in jail for the whole email scandal and there are a lot of people that are saying she is cheating her way through the primaries. As well as she stands for nothing, She is constantly changing her views to just please people. There is a 13 minute video on youtube of her straight up lying for all 13 minutes. \n\nI would really like someone to change my mind and give me some reason to think america will be getting better and not worse after the elections\n_____\n\n> *Hello, users of CMV!

            "selftext": "**Closed elections are not undemocratic.**\n\nI argue that Sanders and his supporters are using selective argumentation to prove that Clinton is only winning the Democratic primaries due to closed elections. I argue that Clinton\u2019s ability to win closed primaries is not because of the lack of independent voters, but because of her more diverse base of supporters in terms demographics in the states that held closed primaries.\n\nThis discussion pertains to the current 2016 U.S. Democratic primaries. Recently, Bernie Sanders and his supporters have been increasingly critical of the current Democratic primary system, particularly closed elections. Though, the Democratic primaries run various types of elections throughout the primary season besides closed elections.\n\nBefore we get into the discussion, here are some information on U.S. primary elections for those who don\u2019t know:\n\n*What are closed elections?*\n\n* **Closed elections** are elections where only people registered as members of a certain party can vote in that primary. Independents and registered members of other parties like the Republican Party are not allowed to vote. This is in direct contrast to open elections.\n\n* This is in contrast to **open elections** where everyone is allowed to vote, regardless of party affiliation or lack thereof.\n\nThere are other types of elections such as semi-closed elections and semi-open elections:\n\n* **Semi-closed elections** allow party members and unaffiliated voters to vote, leaving out people from other parties.\n\n* **Semi-open elections** are pretty much open elections except that unlike open elections where voters are given a ballot and on the ballot they choose which party to vote for, in semi-open elections, voters must declare party they wish to vote for and are then given a party-specific ballot. For all intents and purposes, semi-open elections are essentially open elections.\n\n\nFurthermore, elections are either primaries or caucuses. These types of elections do not pertain to who can participate in the election, but rather how elections are conducted. Primaries are essentially normal elections while caucuses are town hall meetings where delegates who support the same candidate group up and whichever candidate has the most support wins.\n\nClosed elections have been a staple of both Democratic and Republican primaries for years. Once upon a time, all party elections were closed. In fact, back then, nominees were not chosen by the people in an election, but instead they were chosen in a single National convention by party leaders only. Things have changed. Parties now host elections open to normal people. This is due to the fact that the old system was simply undemocratic and it sometimes led to unelectable people being chosen as the nominees. Elections open to normal people is an easy way to determine if a candidate is electable or not. However, state parties are given the choice on whether to run a closed, open, semi-closed, and semi-open election. Closed elections have been a part of the primary process for years and have not really been a huge issue until this election. And it wasn\u2019t until the New York Democratic primary where the issue really became controversial.\n\n*What is the purpose of closed elections?*\n\n* The purpose of closed elections is to keep outsiders out. The reason for this is the belief that only true supporters of a party know who would best represent them.\n\n* There is also a fear of saboteurs or \u201craiders\u201d from other parties that might purposely vote for weaker candidates to make the election easier for their preferred candidate from other parties. Though this occurrence is rare, it has happened before recently. In 2008, Rush Limbaugh pushed Republican voters to vote for Hillary Clinton over Barack Obama because Barack Obama was seen as the stronger candidate. In 2012, Democratic voters in Michigan voted in the Republican primary for Rick Santorum in an effort to prevent the nomination of Mitt Romney, who was seen as the stronger candidate.\n\n*Why have closed elections become so controversial?*\n\n* **Bernie Sanders** is a major candidate for the Democratic Presidential nomination, he is currently second place in pledged delegates. He tends to be more popular among independents than current Democratic frontrunner Hillary Clinton. Because independents are locked out of closed elections, supposedly a large part of his potential voters are locked out, leading many to believe that closed elections are undemocratic.\n* Because closed elections only allow party members to vote, closed elections tend to favor party favorites. The current party favorite is **Hillary Clinton**, who tends to be more popular among Democratic Party members. As a result, she stands most to gain by having closed elections.\n\nThere are several problems with this argument:\n\nThe most obvious being that Clinton has won 10/13 open primaries so far (11/14 if you count semi-open primaries). The most common counter to this point is that most of those primaries were in the Deep South, which are usually conservative and don\u2019t vote Democrat anyway. There are several problems with this counterpoint is that:\n\n* First off, such a dismissal unfairly diminishes the results of the battleground states that held open primaries. Only two battleground states held an open primary and that was Ohio (semi-open) and Virginia, both of which were won by Hillary Clinton. If we consider independents as undecided voters or voters in the middle who can swing elections as they usually do, naturally, they would be more influential and more numerous in the swing states. If there were places that the supposed independent voting bloc that Sanders always touts about could have swung elections his way it was those two states. They didn\u2019t.\n\n* Secondly, the idea that the South is conservative and therefore categorically against Sanders is a fundamental misunderstanding of the Southern electorate, a mistake that has led to the rise of Trump in the South and has led to Sanders tremendous losses there. **The South may be socially conservative, but they are not fiscally conservative.**\n\n* Why do you think Trump won a large part of the Deep South? Was it because Southerners are just racist and hate immigrants? No, it\u2019s his economic policies that attracted Southerners. Early on, he called for taxes to decrease on the poor and taxes to increase on the wealthy (though this is a lie or truth, depending on who you ask). He called for keeping Medicare and Social Security at a time when Republicans were calling for them to be cut. He called for a replacement of Obamacare with something similar to Canada\u2019s healthcare system. These are leftist economic views that Sanders touts. Southerners are predominantly working class whites and blacks who stand most to gain from Sanders policies.\n\n* Perhaps it was because he\u2019s socially liberal? Then what is Clinton? A gun-loving racist? They\u2019re basically the same in terms of socially liberal values. His failure to reach them stems from his inability to connect with those voters personally, which Clinton achieves by appealing to the blacks.\n\n* If anything, Clinton\u2019s ability to win in the Deep South is a testament to her diverse electorate and, thus, her superior electability compared to Sanders. This attitude that Sanders and his supporters are taking in dismissing the South as \u201cdistorting reality\u201d is a defeatist attitude that haunts Sanders even in the Northeastern states that Sanders likes to tout about. Why do you think minorities in the Northeastern states, especially blacks, vote overwhelmingly in favor of Clinton? Are they socially and fiscally conservative? Or are they just more attracted to Clinton than Sanders on a personal level?\n\n\nThe second most obvious hole in Sanders\u2019 argument is that Sanders has won 6/9 closed caucuses so far (6/7 if you only count states). If it really were the case that Clinton has a much bigger advantage in closed elections than in open elections, wouldn\u2019t closed caucuses basically be the ultimate advantage for Clinton? If we consider the argument that closed primaries limiting the potential amount of voters are an advantage for Clinton, surely a closed caucus, which drastically results in a low amount of voters, would give an even bigger advantage to Clinton? This is not the case. Strangely enough, in some of the most fiscally conservative states Sanders has swept closed caucuses. The only closed caucuses Clinton has won was in Nevada, a swing state, and the American Samoa and the Northern Marianas. It\u2019s obvious to see why a place like deeply liberal Maine would vote for Sanders. Though it\u2019s amazing to see that deeply fiscally conservative places like Wyoming, Alaska, Nebraska, and Kansas would vote for Sanders. Aren\u2019t they fiscally conservative strongholds, directly opposite to Sanders views? If we examine Sanders and his supporters\u2019 argument that conservatism, more specifically fiscal conservatism, is his biggest weakness which led to his blowouts in the South, then why doesn\u2019t this argument apply to actually fiscally conservative places like these states? One counterpoint would be that because elections are closed only real hardline liberals would be registered Democrats in such fiscally conservative states. But why can such hardline liberals only sprout in these places and not places like New York? Surely there are hardline liberals registered as Democrats in those states? The real reason why such states voted heavily in favor of Sanders is because of **their lack of diversity, a.k.a. their overwhelming non-Hispanic white population.**\n\n* The states of Wyoming, Alaska, Nebraska, Kansas, and even the swing state of Colorado, are heavily white. Heavier than other closed election states like New York and Maryland. When you compare the results of these two groups of closed election states and their demographics, it becomes easy to see why Sanders ultimately lost those states. New York, in particular, is \u201conly\u201d 56.5% non-Hispanic white as opposed to Colorado\u2019s 70% non-Hispanic White population. When you remember that minorities vote heavily in favor of Clinton, which comprise 43.5% of New York, and whites are typically split between young and old, it\u2019s easy to see that Clinton, compared to Sanders, has a huge advantage over Sanders in terms of diversity and broadness in her voter base. The split between young and old whites is less of an issue in heavily white states because inevitably there are more young white voters than old white voters. However, that split becomes an issue when you add minorities, especially blacks into the equation. Minorities staunchly in support of Clinton, young and old. That staunch support along with the split in whites is winning Clinton the primaries.\n\n* This is the same story in Maryland where non-Hispanic whites only comprise 52.6% of the population. Clinton won even harder in Maryland than in New York (63% vs. 57%). Contrary to popular belief, open primaries would not have saved Sanders from either demographic nightmare. Unsurprisingly, Clinton\u2019s struggled as white population increased, winning Pennsylvania by only 55% and 78% non-Hispanic white, Connecticut by 51% and 69% white. Clinton\u2019s lost Rhode Island, 74.5% non-Hispanic White.\n\n\nThe third hole in his argument is that independents are only heavily influential in swing states. The idea that independent voters will have a bigger impact in deep blue states than swing states contradicts the idea of what an independent voter is. If we go back to my first argument that independent voters are the ones that decide results in battleground states the most, wouldn\u2019t it be natural that they would comprise a higher percentage of the electorate in the swing states than in the red and blue states? If the supposed independent bloc are the ones pushing Sanders above Clinton, why didn\u2019t he win swing states with open primaries? More importantly, why wasn\u2019t he even competitive in them? He was blown out in both Virginia and Ohio. Was it because of demographics? Yes and no. Virginia is 63% non-Hispanic white whereas Ohio is 80% non-Hispanic white. Virginia can be chalked up to another demographic nightmare. Ohio on the other hand is peculiar. Why would an 80% non-Hispanic white state that had an open (semi-open) primary vote for Clinton. It\u2019s a swing state, too, meaning that there are more independent voters than normal. **The answer could very well be Sanders is not as popular among independent as he or his supporter like you to believe.** Sanders is certainly more popular among independents compared to Clinton. That\u2019s no question, the polls all show it and the primary results speak for themselves. But we must re-examine the polls. Clinton, despite being so \u201cunpopular\u201d among independents still leads Trump and Cruz in the polls. Despite having less popularity than Sanders among independents, she still pulls enough of their support as well as the staunch support of minorities and traditional Democrats to give her the edge over Sanders. Sanders was given two free shots at proving his cross-cutting appeal by winning the open primaries of Ohio and Virginia and he was blown out.\n\nThe real reason why Sanders is losing closed primaries is not because of the lack of independent voters, it\u2019s because of his narrow voter base compared to Clinton. Think about it. Sanders has only been successful in heavily non-Hispanic white states, whether open, closed, semi-open, or semi-closed. The only really diverse that he\u2019s won so far is Michigan, which is still 75.6% non-Hispanic white, a far cry from 56% and 52% shown by New York and Maryland. The idea that an open primary could\u2019ve saved Sanders is not only preposterous, it\u2019s insulting to the minorities who still staunchly support Clinton. Perhaps, states like Pennsylvania and Connecticut could\u2019ve been won by Sanders had they been open. They\u2019re mostly white, the demographics fit it. If anything, the fact that they\u2019re not swing states, makes it even easier for Sanders. But that\u2019s just it. If his greatest strength is his so-called independent bloc, **why can\u2019t he win a state like Ohio or Virginia?** Don\u2019t forget Nevada or Florida. Nevada was Clinton\u2019s only win in the closed causes in mainland United States. Unsurprisingly, that was the least whitest of the closed caucuses: 51.5% non-Hispanic white. Florida, a closed primary is 55% non-Hispanic white. Do you people honestly think Sanders had a chance in hell of winning those primaries with those demographics? Get out.\n\nIn short, I guess I didn't prove that closed elections were undemocratic. But I sought to prove that the reasons that Sanders' supporters had for why they are undemocratic are just invalid.\n\nChange my view.\n\n_____\n\n> *Hello, users of CMV!

            "selftext": "**NOTE: THE POINT HAS BEEN PARTIALLY CONCEDED. SEE EDIT #3**\n\nDonald Trump's tax plan is estimate to raise the deficit by[ an unprecedented 10 trillion dollars](http://www.politico.com/story/2015/09/donald-trump-tax-plan-analysis-deficit-214211) over the next decade. While this deficit is coming largely from a decrease in taxes, there are no estimates I'm aware of that the resulting growth in GDP would come even close to make up for it.\n\nIn order to pay for this, Trump has only (as far as I know) suggested cutting two federal agencies: The EPA and the DoE. However, the EPA's annual budget is only about $8 billion and about $108 billion on the DoE. Cutting those two departments from the budget totally would only make up for 10% of the revenue loss Trump proposes.\n\nAdditionally, Trump has pledged to spend more on the Military, infrastructure, and a border wall with Mexico estimated to cost billions of dollars, which I don't believe for a second Mexico will pay for. At the end of the day, Trump's federal budget will be a net increase of expenditures with a net decrease of revenue.\n\nSince it is the economically conservative position to *not* have the federal government run on ever-increasing deficits, the fact that Hillary Clinton's plan does not increase the deficit by this much makes her the more economically conservative candidate by default.\n\nEDIT: Since the discussion is turning into a debate over what I mean by \"conservative\" and \"liberal,\" here are my definitions copied from one of my responses:\n\n----\n**Conservatism** is the support of traditional morals and values (in the American context, the support of the Protestant Christian moral and value system), limited federal government power, lower taxes, less government spending, fewer government programs, the preference for private enterprise over public works, and the promotion of the traditional 18th - 20th century American family structure (one man, one woman, and children).\n\n\n**Liberalism** is the support for acceptance of a variety of moral and value systems, increased federal government oversight, a progressive tax tier with very high taxes for higher income brackets, comprehensive government public welfare programs, the preference for public works over private enterprise, and the inclusion of new and non-traditional family structures.\n_____\n\nEDIT #2: A number of posters are missing the nuance of my post. Please keep in mind that I am discussing how each candidate's plans stack up to the conservative ideal ***WHEN IT COMES TO ECONOMIC POLICY AND ONLY ECONOMIC POLICY!***\n\nIn order to change my view, you will have to provide evidence that Trump's economic policies will result in a lower deficit than Clinton's. This is not snark, and I do not believe this is an impossible task. I am definitely willing to consider changing my view if someone provides me with evidence counter to what I have presented.\n\nI will no longer respond to comments that go outside of the economic policy scope. I thought my inclusion of the word \"Economically\" in the title would be sufficient to keep the discussion along those lines, but apparently I was incorrect.\n\n----\n\nEDIT #3: Apparently I am guilty of misreading some of the posts here, and for that I apologize. I concede that Trump is more conservative than Clinton when it comes to economic policy as a whole. When I said economic policy what I meant was the deficit specifically. However, I did not specify this originally, so I have awarded Deltas to those who pointed this out. \n\nI will award additional Deltas to anyone who can convince me Trump won't increase the deficit as much as Clinton will.\n\n> *Hello, users of CMV!

For the scope of this CMV, I'll focus on the e-mail scandal.\n\nThere's four factors I find particularly interesting:\n\n- She used her blackberry outside of her office numerous times regardless of the warnings she was given concerning security.\n\n- She had a private server in her basement that she told no other officials about.\n\n- Her justification about not using a computer located in the office was her lack of familiarity with them(give me a break).\n\n- She was told to regard *ALL* information as classified even if it was not specifically labeled as such by the State Department.\n\nGiven all of the above, she has fallen under the criteria of \"light\" treason. I understand the FBI is still on the case, but I don't see them following through on indicting her. They've been on this case how long? Furthermore, everything I listed above can easily be google searched so I'm wondering what other proof is needed?\n\nShe has consciously broken the law and isn't facing punishment. Had any other Joe Everyman also working for the government done the same, they'd be out of a career and most likely a life outside of a jail cell.\n\nMaybe I'm overreacting, so feel free to do your best to CMV.\n\nTo sum up: Clinton broke the law and is still not facing punishment. I don't see how she would at this rate. Change this view, you are not trying to convince me to vote for her.\n\nedit: I'll keep responding to responses as I find time(they really came in a burst), but so far my view has been changed to:\n\nClinton hasn't committed any form of treason, but I still believe her and other high ranking politicians to be above us in the eyes of the law. If anyone can change this view, more deltas will be given!~~\n\n\n**BIG OL' EDIT: So some people who are later to the party keep refuting older parts of my view that have already been changed, so I'll just start fresh here:\n\nMy new view is now that Clinton hasn't committed treason(as that is inaccurate) and instead that her and other politicians like her are above the law compared to the average citizen. I'll award deltas accordingly to those who swayed me this way. Is it fair? Nope. But this is the reality of the world we live in. I will continue responding erratically. Sorry, Fridays are usually busy for me and SO many people responded. Way more than I expected to be quite frank.**\n\nThank you all for your contributions in the comments.

The worst trump has said were some questionable things about hispanics and Muslims. \n\nAlso, in recent polls [Trump beats Clinton](http://www.wnd.com/2016/05/poll-trump-pops-into-lead-against-hillary/)... it used to be the other way around but as of recent it looks like Trump will beat Clinton.\n\nOn top of that, people are sick and tired of establishment politics.

            "selftext": "Now before I start, I should make clear that I'm 16 and live in Canada, so I will not personally be voting. That said, based on what I know about the US election, I would say Sanders is the best of the major candidates. Sanders seems to me to be the only candidate whose biggest draw is his actual polices rather than superficial characteristics. I'm going to run through the candidates in what I feel is the descending order of how good they are likely to be as president and go through what seem to me to be the main arguments for each one, and why I think Sanders' draws are the most valid.\n\nBernie Sanders' draws:\n* Single-payer healthcare (an issue I think the US has been lagging behind the rest of the developed world on for a long time; it's unlikely it'll happen within his term, but you can't succeed if you don't try)\n* Free public college tuition (My knee-jerk reaction is to say this is impractical, but a number of other countries have already done this, so I'm not willing to rule it out completely. The main concern, it seems, is that some states won't chip in, which is valid, but at the same time it may be better to have it in some states than none.)\n* He's the most anti-war (This is a big one. Clinton is far too hawkish for my tastes. Some have tried to turn this into a negative by acting like he's against all war, which is false-he opposed Iraq and Vietnam, yes, but supported the War in Afghanistan)\n* He's honest and consistent in his values (Superficial characteristics rather than policies, but nevertheless valid, I think. Some claim that this isn't true because he's making promises he knows he can't keep, which is true, but then so did just about every elected official ever, and so are Clinton and Trump-at least he's honest enough [to admit to it](http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/onpolitics/2016/02/29/bernie-sanders-half-loaf-super-tuesday/81116776/))\n* He's not in the pocket of corporations (superficial and less important, but still a point in his favour)\n\nHillary Clinton's draws:\n* She'd be the first female president (and Sanders would be the first Jewish president. So?)\n* She agrees with Sanders on 90% of issues (true, but what makes her better on the remaining 10%?)\n* She's more likely to get her goals accomplished than Sanders (Bullshit! I don't think anyone has EVER been elected to a political office without making promises they knew they wouldn't keep. The difference is that Sanders' policies are radical enough that he could only get half of what he wants accomplished and still have a significant positive effect on the country)\n* She's not as corrupt as people say she is (...OK, but she's still corrupt)\n* She has a lot of experience in politics (Sanders was Mayor of Burlington and has been in Congress for a long time, so this is like saying you should vote for her over Sanders because she's a Democrat)\n* She's more likely to beat Trump than Sanders (In the polls, Sanders beats Trump by more significant margins than Clinton does; anyways, this is a Catch-22-\"people shouldn't vote for Sanders because people won't vote for Sanders\")\n\nDonald Trump:\n* He's honest (bullshit, he's probably the biggest liar of them all)\n* You know what he's going to do (Heh??? His platform changes by the hour!)\n* He's not a pushover (seems to be true, but that doesn't change that his ideas are crap)\n* He's not as much of a lunatic as he portrays himself as (see: Clinton and corruption)\n* He's not controlled by the wealthy (Really? He doesn't control himself?)\n\nNote: I am mainly interested in arguments based on the candidates\u2019 policies, not their personalities.\n\n**EDIT: My view has been changed. Thank you to /u/SomeDefunctEconomist. I'm still not a fan of Clinton or Trump, but I see now that Sanders' policies have a ton of practical issues that I hadn't really thought about.**\n\nEDIT: So, despite the strong arguments of /u/SomeDefunctEconomist and others, this thread has proved my point very well. A lot of people are trying to convince me by attacking Sanders with varying degrees of validity, some are defending the superficial qualities I listed, a few are arguing about whether Sanders has a shot at winning, one or two people are trying to find a clever-sounding way of saying \"Yeah, well that's just, like, your opinion, man\", and everyone is carefully avoiding giving any useful information about Hillary Clinton and/or Donald Trump. Nobody's even attempted to name a single redeeming quality for either.\n\nHillary Clinton supported the PATRIOT ACT, [claimed Hosni Mubarak was a friend of her family](http://blogs.abcnews.com/politicalpunch/2011/01/secretary-clinton-in-2009-i-really-consider-president-and-mrs-mubarak-to-be-friends-of-my-family.html), [couldn't come up with an answer when asked to name something she had accomplished as Secretary of State, has been described by dozens of administration officials, foreign diplomats, friends, and outside analysts as consistently being \"almost always the advocate of the most aggressive actions considered by Mr. Obama\u2019s national security team \u2014 and not just in well-documented cases, like the debate over how many additional American troops to send to Afghanistan or the NATO airstrikes in Libya\"](http://www.nytimes.com/2014/04/17/us/politics/unfinished-business-complicates-clintons-diplomatic-legacy.html?_r=1), [implied that mass incarceration of black youths isn't a real issue](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LqLfvQfuvsA) [and then changed her platform to what BLM protesters were demanding anyway a few days later](http://time.com/time-person-of-the-year-2015-runner-up-black-lives-matter/), [has pushed back against banning fracking in countries around the world and accepted over a million dollars in campaign donations from lobbyists for and executives of oil and gas companies despite pro-environmentalist rhetoric and having attacked Obama for taking a much smaller amount of money from oil companies during the 2008 election](http://www.greenpeace.org/usa/campaign-updates/hillary-clintons-connection-oil-gas-industry/) (to be fair, [Sanders has also accepted (a much smaller amount of) money in campaign donations from oil company executives](http://www.greenpeace.org/usa/these-are-the-facts-on-fossil-fuel-money-going-to-the-clinton-and-sanders-campaigns/)), [oversaw hundreds of billions of dollars worth of arms sales to brutal dictatorships in the Middle East because of the tyrants in power having donated to the Clinton Foundation](http://www.motherjones.com/politics/2015/05/hillary-clinton-foundation-state-arms-deals), [illegally obtained (along with her husband) FBI files on political adversaries](http://www.nytimes.com/1996/06/11/us/whitewater-counsel-examining-use-of-fbi-to-get-gop-files.html), etc., etc., and I haven't even gotten into the main things I've seen her getting attacked for-the e-mail scandal, supporting the war in Iraq, and flip-flopping on gay marriage-yet.\n\nAs for Trump, he supports banning Muslims from immigrating, building a border wall and get Mexico to pay for it (??), beheading the family members of terrorists, and revoking prohibitions on torture as punishment, plus he [used to keep a book of Hitler's speeches by his bedside table (seriously)](http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/donald-trump-used-to-keep-a-book-of-hitlers-speeches-by-his-bed-according-to-his-ex-wife-a6765391.html), [is in nearly a billion dollars of *personal* debt (how is that even possible?)-roughly a quarter of his total net worth-that he just quietly ignores](http://fortune.com/2016/03/23/donald-trump-debt/), denies the existence of global warming for reasons that make it obvious he doesn't even know what the term means (or pretends not to), has changed his mind about what party he belongs to five times since the '90s, supported the wars in Iraq, Afghanistan, and Libya and lied about all three when it became politically convenient, pretended not to know who David Duke was after Duke started supporting his campaign despite having repeatedly and publicly condemned Duke in the past, advocates reversing the progress Obama made regarding healthcare by repealing the ACA, made up a conspiracy theory about Mexico sending rapists into the US for... some reason and claimed to have gotten it from border guards, [attempted to discredit Ted Cruz by making up another conspiracy theory about his father having been involved in the shooting of JFK based on a photo in which the face he claims is Cruz' father isn't even identifiable](http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2016/may/03/donald-trump/donald-trumps-ridiculous-claim-linking-ted-cruzs-f/), [opposes same-sex marriage for reasons that sound like they came straight out of a *Monty Python* skit](http://www.fstdt.com/QuoteComment.aspx?QID=81168), [freely admits to and openly brags about bribing politicians](http://www.cnbc.com/2015/09/17/donald-trump-is-right-paying-politicians-pays.html), etc., etc.\n\nBernie Sanders has some horrible ideas, I admit, particularly in regards to his extreme opposition to free trade and I don't particularly like the idea of his being President. But he also has some ideas which I strongly agree with-single-payer healthcare, avoiding going to war where possible, and ending dependence on fossil fuels among them-so I can at least see a silver lining, and he doesn't seem to be a bad person. I see no big upsides to either Hillary Clinton or Donald Trump getting elected.\n\nThis is not a choice between Bernie Sanders, George Washington, and Abraham Lincoln. It's not even a choice between Bernie Sanders, Benjamin Harrison, and George HW Bush. From what I can see, the choice is whether you prefer your leaders to be inept (Sanders), corrupt (Clinton), or insane (Trump). I maintain Sanders is the least of three evils in this case.\n\nEDIT: Holy fuck, I've forgotten maybe the worst thing about Clinton. [She wants a no-fly zone in Syria](http://www.independent.co.uk/voices/merkel-wants-a-no-fly-zone-in-syria-but-has-she-thought-it-through-a6879901.html). When asked how she would deal with Russian planes continuing to fly over the area, Clinton said she would let them off with a warning the first two times, then failed to answer what she would do the third time. There's really only two ways that policy can go: either the US wastes a fuckton of money on a meaningless gesture that can't be enforced without starting WWIII, or, WWIII. That alone is enough to dispel any notion of Clinton being the \"realistic\", \"pragmatic\", or \"sensible\" candidate, and to dissuade me from supporting her.\n\n_____",

            "selftext": "With the election shaping up to look like a match-up between Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump, there has been much talk about what to do about so-called \"Rational Republicans.\" I am referring to Republicans who are ideologically aligned with people like Jeb Bush, Marco Rubio, John Kasich, Paul Ryan etc. and likely supported one of the first three names listed in the Republican primary. Many of these Republicans have been openly \"Never Trump\" and have spoken repeatedly about the harm that a Trump presidency could have on the United States and the Republican party. It is rare for such a large block of Republicans to be so opposed to their presumptive nominee and it presents a tempting opportunity for Clinton supporters to recruit these \"Rational Republicans\" to the Clinton cause to help Clinton win in an electoral landslide. I personally believe this is a very bad idea.\n\nFirst, Clinton is already a clear favorite over Donald Trump in a general. Virtually every national poll has shown Clinton with a sizable lead. Trump and Clinton are extremely well known and most people have a firmly established opinion of both candidates. That makes it so that polls even this far out, are less likely to change. Demographics that hate Trump (minorities, women etc.) aren't likely to change as it takes something extraordinary to change a long term and firmly held belief.\n\nSecond, demographics were already on the Democrats' side. Even before Trump was the nominee, Republicans knew the 2016 presidential election was going to be an uphill climb. In the post-2012 election defeat autopsy, Republican leaders acknowledged that the electoral math simply does not add up unless the Republicans do better with Latino voters. With Trump alienating Latinos at a greater rate than previous Republican candidates, it is unlikely that we will see a reversal of the trends in electoral voting that have emerged in recent elections. Trumps claims that he will re-set the electoral map are dubious at best and not supported by his extremely high unfavorable ratings with core constituencies that would be required for such a massive shift.\n\nThird, courting Republicans will alienate devoted progressives and it will be a net loss in Democratic voter totals. Many left-wing Sanders supporters have derided Clinton for not being a true progressive. Moving further to the right to court \"Rational Republicans\" will only further infuriate progressive Sanders supporters making them more likely to vote third party if they choose to vote at all. \"Rational Republicans\" also speak openly about their hatred for Clinton, and while their hatred for Trump might outweigh their hatred for Clinton, it is likely that many \"Rational Republicans\" will choose not to vote for either candidate.\n\nFourth, and most importantly, this election presents a massive opportunity for Democrats to seize control of the House and Senate. The single greatest driver of voter turnout is a Presidential election. House and Senate elections see significantly lower turnouts during mid-term elections than in years with a presidential election. Many voters tend to vote purely along party lines, and as such, voters who vote for a president from a particular party are much more likely to also vote for Congressional candidates of the same party. \"Rational Republicans\" would likely be the exception to this idea. Their vote for Hillary would likely not be an indicator of increased support for Democratic candidates for the House and Senate. Increased turnout among \"Rational Republicans\" would likely be a good sign for Republican candidates for Congress. On the other hand, increased turnout from progressive Sanders supporters would likely boost the chances of Democratic congressional candidates. The best thing that can happen for Democrats in down ticket races is for \"Rational Republicans\" to be demoralized seeing no suitable candidate for President to motivate them to get out to the polls and for progressives to come out in force.\n\nP.S. If any Bernie supporters are going to argue that Bernie will get the nomination, my argument is based in the extremely likely world in which Hillary wins the nomination. Whether Bernie can/will win the nomination is a separate argument from this post.\n_____\n\n> *Hello, users of CMV! This is a footnote from your moderators.

Can you do a background check on all of them? Does posing for a photo with someone mean that you fully endorse every single one of their ideas? Has she ever proclaimed sympathies for the KKK?\n\nThe answer to all of these is 'no' and this whole shtick is eyeroll-inducing.\n\nP.S.: I am aware that /r/The_Donald is a satire sub that thrives on memes and circle-jerking. That's not the point I am addressing, my contention is that a picture like that isn't a big deal.\n\n_____\n\n> *Hello, users of CMV! This is a footnote from your moderators.

            "selftext": "I'm actually an independent and supporter of Bernie, but with all the vitriol and passion about these proceedings, I took the time to actually look into the details behind them.  After looking into many allegations, I'm thinking that most of the indignation is based upon unfamiliarity with the system. Here are the main complaints I'm reading about ([source article](https://shadowproof.com/2016/05/17/democrats-manipulated-nevada-state-party-convention-blamed-sanders-chaos/)) :\n\n* Lange and an executive board secretly voted on rules two weeks before the convention to give Lange \u201cexclusive control\u201d over the convention and strictly limit motions, as well as challenges to rulings by the chair.\n\nThis wasn't some secret coup. This is the way the process is generally handled. Here are the rules for 2016 that were \"secretly voted on\":\n\nhttp://nvdems.3cdn.net/ea5a7f0df495b0cf4c_z2m6bnqh5.pdf\n\nHere are the equivalent rules that were voted on the same way 4 years ago:\n\nhttp://nvdems.3cdn.net/93e6d8a5dd36cd22b4_brm6iivph.pdf\n\nYes, there are some differences, but if those differences were made to subvert control, it is much more subtle than implied. The chair always had the same \"exclusive control\" that is being complained about. Is it right? Maybe not, but it's not some Hillary-controlled attempt to steal the convention from Bernie.\n\n* Voted on \u201ctemporary rules\u201d for the convention and cheated by calling the vote for the \u201cyeas\u201d when the \u201cnays\u201d clearly had larger numbers. The vote happened early at 9:30 am before all the delegates had arrived.\n\nThe convention was supposed to convene at 9 AM and votes are allowed once quorum is reached (40% of delegates seated). The fact is that check-in and registration were available the night before and Saturday check-in wasn't even supposed to start until 10 AM.\n\nWas Lange trying to sneak a coup in before Sanders supporters could oppose it? No. The \"Temporary rules\" are always temporary until the first vote of the convention! They are written that way to allow for changes if necessary. Was a voice vote incorrectly interpreted by Lange? It's certainly possible, but I have yet to see any video or even a picture of seated delegates to suggest it wasn't a fair vote.\n\n* The State Democratic Party was provided with petitions from twenty percent of the delegates in attendance to challenge the adopted rules. Signatures were collected ahead of the convention because there were activists well-aware of what the Party would try to do with the new \u201ctemporary rules.\u201d \n\nI've heard several claims about this petition, but I have yet to see anything about that petition or the number of names it had. The petition would have had to offer a specific motion to amend and no one has even offered what that motion might have been.\n\nThe best way to change my view would probably be related to this point.  If someone can show some evidence that a legitimate petition was callously disregarded at the convention, then I'll certainly award a delta.\n\n* Lange granted herself the authority to have the final decision on all the delegates excluded from the convention. There were 56 Sanders delegates and four Clinton delegates, which were deemed to have improper or inadequate registration information. The number of Clinton delegates outnumbered Sanders delegates by only 33 delegates.\n\nAs normal, Lange was responsible for appointing members of the Credential Committee. That committee was responsible for denying delegates. While I have little doubt that the committee was probably biased towards Clinton, many members of the committee (including the co-chair) were Sanders supporters.\n\n\nGiven that Bernie wasn't a Democrat last year, it isn't very surprising that the majority of the delegates that were denied for not being registered democrats were Bernie supporters. We're talking about a total of 58 delegates denied out of about 3000.  Yes, the final count was close enough to make those few delegates count, but this sounds like a somewhat honest bias against the Sanders delegates.\n\n* When one of the members of the state party committees attempted to read a \u201cMinority Report,\u201d reflecting what had happened with the decision to exclude 56 Sanders delegates, Lange tried to take the microphone out of the hand of the person, who was about to read the report.\n\nLange told her not to give the report at that point.  There was no \"trying to take the microphone\".  She was later given the microphone to give her report:\n\nhttps://youtu.be/MrKEgxAdhO8?t=9m30s\n\n* Multiple attempts were made to bring motions in order to remove Lange as chair of the state party convention because it appeared to be Lange who was responsible for eruptions of disorder. Congressional candidate Dan Rolle hopped on a megaphone to make a motion and had the megaphone confiscated. Then, Rolle tried again later when he had access to the microphone to make a motion for a \u201cno confidence\u201d vote. The leadership cut off his microphone.\n\nDan Rolle knew that this motion was against the rules. Of course those motions were going to be ignored. The convention was operating under the (apparently reasonable) assumption that the rules were legitimate and those rules precluded such motions.\n\n* Nina Turner, one of the most prominent and well-respected Sanders surrogates, was there to represent his campaign at the convention. Yet, abruptly, the leadership switched the order and had Senator Barbara Boxer go on stage to speak for the Clinton campaign. Her speech riled up supporters, and as she was booed, she kept riling them up by berating them.\n\nSure, Boxer spoke, but how did this deny Turner?  Nina Turner actually had a great speech at the convention! You can watch it here . Rather than objecting to how things were going, she was actually asking the crowd to remain calm and follow the procedures!\n\n* Lange moved to adjourn the convention when there was a motion made for a recount on the floor late in the convention.\nMotions from the floor were against the rules, so they were being ignored. Everyone was assuming that Roberts Rules of Order were in effect, but that is not how the state conventions work!\n\nGiven how the vote actually went down, I can see some validity to the argument that Lange shouldn't have adjourned the meeting, but they were being kicked out by the venue and I can certainly understand her frustrations.\n\n* State Democratic Party leadership refused to acknowledge delegates from the Sanders side, who were following the rules to make motions, and effectively sowed chaos in the process. As they fled the convention after abruptly adjourning, Las Vegas metro police lined the stage. Sanders delegates contemplated a civil disobedience action in response, but eventually, most left the room as it was cleared. This image of police in the room helped the Party spread propaganda in the hours after that it was the Sanders people who were \u201cviolent,\u201d and brought the convention to the point of chaos where it was not safe for people anymore.\n\nAs I said before, none of these motions and points of order had a place in the convention. The venue itself was trying to get people out of the room and that is why police were called. The delegates were trespassing and didn't even know it!\n\nI realize that this sort of format puts me at risk of putting forth a straw man argument, so if there's a major concern or objection that better exemplifies the outrage I'm seeing, please bring it to my attention.  \n_____\n\n> *Hello, users of CMV!

Please provide proof or reason and change my mind.  \n\n\n\nIn this I'd like to assume Bernie doesn't get it and doesn't run a third party because obviously that changes a lot. I'm talking strictly Hillary vs Trump with Johnson and that girl from the Green party (sorry forgot her name) it seems like people are saying it will be close when it seems like every poll minus the two that were wrong in 2012 are stating the opposite. \n\n\n\n\nWithout fighting and name calling please CMV ",

            "selftext": "Hi people. I'm not American so I don't get a vote, but have been following your current political situation as it's going to have repercussions throughout the world.\n\nAt the start of your primary race, I thought that Trump was the most repulsive political candidate anyone could imagine. I was wrong, there were worse potential candidates that not only existed but were running with the chance for nomination.\n\nNow that it's looking like it's going to be Trump vs Clinton, and the corruption, behaviour, deceit and anti-democratic tactics from the  Clinton political machine are looking more insidious and devious and potentially destructive than Trumps name calling, narcissism and authoritarian views. I'm starting to think that Trump might be the better option.\n\nFurther, Trump is nowhere near as bought as Clinton, she appears to be in the pocket of the kind of people who have destroyed you middle class, and removed human rights while expanding inequality to some serious extremes.\n\nWith Trump, there's really no knowing what he's going to do (if you do know, please share it), because he seems to pander to both sides the same as Hillary, but some of the stuff he says is pretty out there, and some of it is actually kind of sensible. But at least with him, you know it's less likely to be for the kind of people who control CNN, MSNBC, the drug companies, the banks; unless he starts taking bribes of course. \n\nPlus if he does push through some serious right wing, neo liberal, free market policies, it will shift the next economic crash forward, so that it brings on the next \"new deal\" or something similar a lot faster. I think he is the candidate that is most likely to bring about change.\n\nIn the meantime, please do your best to get Sanders over the line. At this stage it's looking like he's the only one who could bring about a \"new deal\" the fastest.\n_____\n\n> *Hello, users of CMV! This is a footnote from your moderators.

            "selftext": "First I want to establish that all political cartoons, regardless of what beliefs the artist who made one has, are guilty of this.\n\nBut for this example, [I'll use this one](http://imgur.com/TKKLExo) . I added in some text boxes to show what I dislike about the comic, and explain in further detail below\n\nNotice at first how it frames the argument. The argument that the comic is trying to show as \"wrong\" would be the one where people believe Hillary is not a good presidential candidate, because of email scandal. The framing of the cartoon shows the anti-Hillary supporter as an unreasonable, fat, white, and somewhat rich person. So the unreasonable person also has it easy in life, that's the idea being pushed. At no point does this cartoon address why it's wrong to distrust Clinton based off the email scandal (I'm not making the argument that you should/should not trust hillary, simply that the comic does not even tell us why it's wrong to distrust her). Instead, if you disagree with the cartoonist, you have it easy in life and are most likely an idiot.\n\nAlso not the facial expressions. The white woman has a scoffing look on her face, while the black woman has a somewhat mild look of being disturbed or taken back. We can clearly see how the cartoonist framed the white woman, so naturally you dislike the anti-hillary person. However, people like to see themselves as objective, tempered individuals who are in control of their emotions; they like seeing themselves as rational. So the author has given a self insert for the audience (who are already disliking the opposing point of view) as a rational, objective thinking person. Not only that, but she's a minority who's rather poor. Look at her coat then compare it to the white woman's. Clearly the author is giving the audience a self insert to feel that they're not extravagant, they don't have it easy in life, they're multicultural (and thus modern), and finally they're rational, smart thinkers.\n\n*But does this actually convince anyone? Is this a good argument that can stand up to scrutiny and show us which ideology is right, or the most truthful?* No, it obscures the correct answer in vitriol. You WILL agree with me because if you don't, you're XYZ and that's bad. \n\n**Secondly, it's not even that funny.**\n\nI don't think I've ever laughed or smiled, or even snorted at a political cartoon, even when it's one I somewhat agree with.\n\nThe entire idea of 'humor' here is that anyone who disagrees with you is an ugly, irrational idiot who's as dumb as rocks. The objective is to get you to laugh at those who disagree with you. I've already covered why that's a terrible argument that convinces no one, but it's also just not funny. The only people I know who laugh at this sort of humor are self-obsessed and have disdain for anyone who disagrees with them.\n\nDon't get me wrong, political humor can be done right; I like *calvin and hobbes* a lot. But even Bill watterson has said something along the lines of \"you don't have to make your political point with a sledgehammer\". I can't find it right now, but it's in his 10th anniversary collection book.\n\nAnyways, the humor is awful. It's \"haha look that person disagrees with me haha what an ugly idiot\". This is also why I don't like Jon Stewart and Steven Colbert, because when it comes to their political views they simply mock whoever disagrees with them and make silly faces. \n\nPlease, change my view\n\n_____\n\n> *Hello, users of CMV!

While it's too early to call the upcoming election by any means in terms of who will actually win the title of President, I *think* it's pretty clear that it's going to be a Clinton V. Trump deal(I don't want to say for sure, the numbers seem to be pointing this way). \n\nI don't plan on voting for either as I don't foresee any big differences in my own life from either holding the seat, but one thought I can't help but hold is that a Trump presidency will be bad for Brown Americans. Indian, Pakistani, Lebanese(Admittedly some look more caucasian, but that's not really relevant), Persian, etc(I know there are A LOT more I'm missing out on). \n\nLooking at the footage of Trump supporters at rallies(although I've only seen a few videos, so this isn't necessarily representative of ALL Trump supporters) and the current global political climate specifically in regards to terrorism, I feel like a Trump presidency will inspire a lot more open prejudice towards Brown Americans whether they're Muslim or not. \n\nA lot of the basis of my view is when I think about the average American(even myself included), we don't really seem like the kind of people to try and differentiate between all ethnic groups and their various religious practices. As a result, I expect anyone who is of a brown tone of skin will face some form of discrimination for religious practices they may not even be associated with.\n\nTo sum up since I feel I might have rambled: If Trump is elected, a lot of hatred towards Brown people living in America will start to show itself whether it is accurate or not.\n\n\nedit: TO CLARIFY, I DO NOT BELIEVE TRUMP HIMSELF TO BE NECESSARILY RACIST. Just taking a glance at the groups he appeals to by playing on their fears in regards to terrorism, I believe the racism and ignorance of those groups will become more prevalent.\n\n\n_____\n\n> *Hello, users of CMV!

            "selftext": "I'll preface this by saying that I view Wall Street and investment banking with a contempt few professions inspire, for a wide variety of reasons. After the 2008 crisis, my view was that I'd gladly see half of Wall Street in jail and the other half subject to enough regulation to make Dodd-Frank look like a blurb.\n\nHaving watched political and economic developments over the last few years, that's still a part of my personal utopia, but I don't think it's an effective solution in practice. It seems to me that Wall Street finds new ways to make profits at the expense of its customers (and, when things go really wrong, taxpayers who bail them out) at a remarkably quick pace.\n\nCongress, by contrast, moves far more slowly. The last major reform was Dodd-Frank, passed in 2010, thanks to a Democratic supermajority in the Senate (which happens once in a blue moon), and the financial industry has been lobbying to water many elements of the law down ever since it was passed. A Republican congress will kill any attempts to pass new regulations, or amend existing ones for better enforcement. Even if we get new laws passed, it'll take a long fight, which financial lobbyists and their congressional allies will drag out as much as they can.\n\nNote that I'm not trying to make this a political issue. In 2008, Obama raised plenty of funds from Wall Street, though the numbers dipped in 2012 because his campaign was more populist. Reagan and Clinton both played a part in deregulation. I'm reasonably convinced that a dollar in lobbying money is worth $1 on either side of the aisle.\n\nAnyway, faced with this trend (banks can make changes overnight, the federal government can take years or decades to pass new laws regulating Wall Street), the logical conclusion seems to be that trying to regulate Wall Street is like a game of whack-a-mole, with a very slow hammer and a very fast mole that periodically changes shape so the hammer is useless.\n\nI suspect there's a lot of information out there that I haven't considered, and I'd be glad to have reliable evidence that my view isn't necessarily correct. So, change my view.\n\n_____\n\n> *Hello, users of CMV! This is a footnote from your moderators. We'd just like to remind you of a couple of things.

            "selftext": "Full disclosure: I am a Bernie Sanders supporter. But I also will become a Hillary supporter once the convention is over. She's not the devil and in fact there's a lot to respect, especially if you actually are supporting Sanders for ideological reasons. But anyway, lots of people have been recently calling for Sanders to drop out now that his victory is all but mathematically impossible. But obviously that's not the only facet of the argument; otherwise they would have no basis for calling him to drop out. What they say is that Sanders staying in the race is preventing Democratic unity and keeping Clinton from making her general election pivot to Trump, who is now been focusing all his attention on Hillary as the Republican Party unites around him. The results of this, in the eyes of the Clintonites, are Hillary's troubling polling against Trump nationally and in battleground states. In both cases she is even losing, and when she's not the margin is razor thin most of the time. According to the Sanders detractors, this is the obvious result of Trump having a unified party while Clinton is still engaged in a grueling (despite wining by a landslide in all metrics) nomination battle. There are several flaws with this argument.\n\nFirst of all, Clinton vs. Trump polling has always been close, it's just that now people are paying attention since it's closer to the general and these two are the presumptive nominees. Even as Sanders praised Secretary Clinton and communicated to America how little he cares about her damn emails, Trump vs. Sanders was always a blowout compared to Trump vs. Clinton. That's because it has nothing to do with the state of the Democratic race, but with the candidates themselves. Hillary Clinton is simply a weaker candidate: she is more disliked and mistrusted than Sanders, and she has a whole lot of baggage with her. Yes, she is more ideologically appealing to independents, but the rise of Trump shows that ideology isn't necessarily the biggest factor when it comes to who you vote for. And that's not even mentioning the fact that Sanders does better with independents than Clinton.\n\nThe second flaw is that Democratic unity isn't even threatened. The Democratic party has spent the last four months voting for a candidate, and that candidate is the inevitable nominee. And the entire party leadership is behind her as well. Yes, Sanders voters are a sizeable chunk of the party, but most of them will go to Clinton once she is nominated. The Bernie or Bust movement is a vocal minority, that's it.\n\nLet me conclude by comparing this primary to 2008. That election was much more divisive. It was a much closer race and the Democratic establishment was essentially split on it. It was also nastier in tone, and also slugged on until the convention even as the loser had no chance of winning. There was also a presumptive Republican nominee (with *much* more support from his party and from the American people) who was in general election mode and attacking a divided Democratic field, lowering poll numbers for the eventual nominee. How did that one end? The loser endorsed the winner, brought over their supporters, and gave the Democrats an electoral landslide.",

            "selftext": "I am 18 years old, and very interested in politics. Running for public office and maybe even serving in the Senate is my absolute dream. I have long supported Republicans, and my first vote ever was for John Kasich in my state's primary. To me, he represents the right economic formula to get the country going again. I have a strong respect for the Constitution (gun rights, privacy, etc.) and believe that any power not enumerated in it to the Federal Government should be eliminated.\n\nHowever, I have been having reservations about the GOP as of late. Most of the members' complete disregard for the 4th Amendment right after talking about how great the Constitution is, shunning of candidates that speak out against said invasions of privacy (the Pauls come to mind), constant war-hawking, and blind support of police when I myself have witnessed police brutality on someone I know (it isn't a race issue) have given me second thoughts. I am also an atheist, and while in my area that may be okay when running, I would almost certainly not win a Republican primary in any level.\n\nI have drifted leftward, regardless of my Constitutionalism, on various issues. I hate war, think collective contributions should be banned, etc. Unless your name is Walter Jones or Rand Paul, it's an uphill battle to win a primary with those kind of ideas. \n\nHowever, I still have reservations about the Democrats. Their leadership (Wasserman-Schultz, Reid, Pelosi, Clintons, Obama) are all despicable partisans, and one of my idols, Olympia Snowe, has always said that bipartisanship and working together are always better than constant fighting. They're not enemies, they're coworkers. The party has also been largely co-opted by Social Justice Warriors on one side, and hypocrite corporatists on the other side. Their rallying around someone so horribly corrupt as Hillary Clinton deeply bothers me. They too also disregard parts of the Constitution that they don't like, mainly the 2nd and 1st Amendments. There are exceptions like Mark Warner or Evan Bayh, but they are by far not the prevailing voice of the leadership, who seem more interested in needlessly taxing and regulating everything that moves and demonizing opponents instead of extending olive branches in this polarized time, rather than actually helping people.\n\nI have just as many Democratic friends and connections as Republican ones, and living in New England, it would be much easier to run as a moderate Democrat like Jeanne Shaheen or Maggie Hassan than as a Centrist Constitutionalist Republican.

            "selftext": "We often hear the narrative of \"white privilege\" and the idea that white people and white men specifically have more advantages than minorities and women. This narrative may be true in some regards, and may be exaggerated in others. My CMV isn't predicated on debating if this does or doesn't exist, that debate has been had and usually leads down a downward spiral. \n\nWhat I rather focus on is the idea that other demographics (not white men) have the opportunity to use their demographic as an excuse or justification that absolves them from anything they are doing. I'd like to outline one example below so you understand what I mean:\n\nI was reading through this [thread] (https://www.reddit.com/r/hillaryclinton/comments/4l90tt/its_not_fair_and_im_going_to_rant/) about a Hillary Clinton supporter being frustrated with a potential Bernie v. Trump debate and Hillary not getting her due respect, and they argue that it must be because she's a woman. Using the woman card here as a reason for why Hillary might not be doing so well gave me the idea that when a person is someone who isn't a White male, they can always imply that something doesn't go their way because of their demographic. \n\nIt dawned on me that say the scenario was flipped no one could ever say, oh this is happening to Bernie because he's a male. Maybe if Bernie was a minority they could say it's happening because of his race. Maybe if he was a different sexual orientation, they could say it's because of that. However there's no scapegoat ability for someone who is a straight white male. \n\nI can understand that racism and sexism and homophobia are still things that exist in this world. I can also understand that in cases these things are the reason why certain people feel a certain way about a person or their actions. However I find it quite troubling that there's this \"out card\" (if you will) that exists for every group other than straight white males. \n\nJust looking at the example above objectively, one can see a plethora of reasons for why someone might not support Hillary Clinton. However since she's a woman we must include that as a reason as well. \n\nWe can look at Trump and find plenty of reasons why people won't support him .However you'll never hear it's because he's a white male.\n\nThe fact that the former exists and the latter doesn't makes me believe that non-straight-white-males have the ability to always create a shadow of a doubt about the reaction to their actions by claiming discrimination. Even if discrimination is really nowhere to be found. This scapegoat ability exists for them but will never exist for straight-white-males. \n\nIf you believe that heterosexual white men do have the same scapegoating ability as other demographic groups, please CMV.\n\n\n_____\n\n> *Hello, users of CMV!

            "selftext": "Bernie Sanders has spent most of his campaign criticizing the DNC and suggesting that the way it has handled this primary season has been overwhelmingly undemocratic and unfair. I don\u2019t disagree with him, and I even voted for Bernie in my primary. We\u2019re now at a point where it\u2019s extremely unlikely that Bernie will gain the popular vote and a majority of the pledged delegates, which means that Bernie\u2019s only hope to clinch the nomination (barring external factors) is to somehow convince superdelegates to support him over Clinton.\n\nI believe this is hypocritical of him, and it\u2019s hypocritical of his supporters to support him in this. One of the key things that appeals to me (and many other voters) about Bernie is his integrity. For him to seek to go over the heads of the voters who have told him \u201cno,\u201d and try to get the nomination anyway clearly goes against a lot of what he stood for up to this point in his campaign. I understand wanting to win, and trying to win, but the moment it\u2019s confirmed that the popular vote and a majority of pledged delegates go to Clinton, continuing to appeal to superdelegates is hypocritical.\n\nCMV.\n_____\n\n> *Hello, users of CMV!

Im not closed-minded about this, and i regularly engage Hillary supporters online hoping to have courteous and intelligent debates. I always seek to learn something i didnt, and I try to give each person the chance to change my mind. No one has been able to do so... Every Hillary supporter Ive engaged has been condescending, ignorant, and evasive. They push the same warped arguments over and over, ignore my counterpoints completely, and then disappear into the mist once the feel cornered, only to pop up again somewhere else on facebook parrotting the same rhetoric. Its been extremely disturbing, especially since the mainstream media seems to push the idea that Bernies supporters are the ones who are always acting out. \n\nEdit: people have been confused by my phrasing. To clarify:\n\nConsidering shes the likely nominee, please sell me on her. Please give me well-thought out reasons as to why you honestly feel shes the best person to be the democratic candidate. Dont shy away from spirited debate, and come up with appropriate responses to my counterpoints. I dont need to agree with your end conclusion, but i want to see that the steps you made to reach that conclusion are sound. This is how you can change my view.\n\nEdit: im only interested in hearing from Hillary Clinton supporters. Not people that would vote for her instead of Trump, people who realllly support her and think shes done an amazing job and should without question be the next president.\n_____\n\n> *Hello, users of CMV!

Hillary's presidency, on the other hand, is predicted to be much like Obamas, and thats not good.

Is a literal billionaire. Don't like the billionaire class using money to influence politics? Well they can just run themselves now! The Kochs should have thought of this! (actually they tried and failed, but that's because they didn't run as republicans). He advocates cutting his own taxes, (http://www.politico.com/story/2016/05/donald-trump-taxes-tax-reform-223041), ending freedom of the press (http://www.politicususa.com/2016/02/27/trump-freedom-press-not-people.html), bringing back \"pre-existing conditions\" (http://www.forbes.com/sites/theapothecary/2016/03/03/the-most-important-thing-about-donald-trumps-health-reform-plan-is-that-donald-didnt-write-it/#3528989130a3)\n\n2. Wants to PURPOSELY murder terrorist sex slaves and their children. This is not only not progressive. It's probably the most immoral policy any presidential nominee has ever advocated- at least as bad as slavery. http://www.cnn.com/2015/12/02/politics/donald-trump-terrorists-families/\n\n3. Is an unapologetic racist against Latinos (http://www.cbsnews.com/news/election-2016-donald-trump-defends-calling-mexican-immigrants-rapists/) and Muslims (http://www.cnn.com/2015/12/07/politics/donald-trump-muslim-ban-immigration/). The KKK loves him! http://www.politico.com/story/2016/02/david-duke-trump-219777\n\nNone of this really gets into his potentially world destabilizing foreign policy or his view that POW's (often the soldiers that go on the most risky missions, risking their lives for their country) are losers, but I wanted to stay focused on \"progressive\" issues. \n\nLook, I know Hillary is crooked to some degree. I get it. She is not ideal for many of you, or even acceptable as a democratic nominee, but you don't play games with who you select as \"the leader of the free world\". Just because you are angry, you can't put this kind of person in power. It makes you worse than anyone running in this race right now.\n\nEDIT: Yes I know I misspelled \"Loses\". Sorry.\n\n_____\n\n> *Hello, users of CMV! This is a footnote from your moderators. We'd just like to remind you of a couple of things.

            "selftext": "I am a Bernie supporter and voted for him in my state's primary. Part of why I support him is because he is a champion for actual democracy -- \"one person, one vote.\"\n\nRecently, Bernie has been saying that if Hillary doesn't have 2382 pledged delegates by the time all of the primaries are over, he will turn to the super delegates and try to get them to change their vote. [[source](http://www.cnn.com/2016/06/04/politics/bernie-sanders-hillary-clinton-convention/), and [link to the original speech](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=035I6c3PuGI&feature=youtu.be&t=5m5s)]\n\nTo me, this seems quite undemocratic. I think that if Bernie thinks superdelegates corrupt our system, then he should ignore the superdelegates count when deciding whether to drop out. \n\nHere's how the math would work:\n\n* In the current system, there is a total (pledged + super) of 4763 delegates, and to get more than 50% requires 2382 delegates. \n* If we ignore superdelegates altogether, there are a total of 4051 pledged delegates. To get more than 50% of those requires winning 2026. \n* If Bernie believes that pledged delegates are a fair form of demooracy, he should stay in the race if he wins 2026 or more (and woo the superdelegates to switch to his side in the name of democracy). \n* However, if Hillary wins 2026 delegates or more, than by Bernie's own view of a fair democracy, Hillary has won. \n\nWhen Bernie uses the 2382 number as the benchmark, he is giving legitimacy to the use of superdelegates in the first place. And by talking about using the superdelegates to win the election even if he does not get more than 50% of pledged delegates, Bernie seems to be embracing the very thing he is fighting against.\n\nI would expect this from other candidates, who have an I-play-within-a-corrupt-system-in-order-to-win attitude, but part of why I support Bernie is because he is not willing to lower himself or compromise his values for the sake of winning. A part of me wants to say 'I want Bernie to be the nominee, and if the only way for that to happen is for him to work the superdelegates then so be it' -- but I feel like this behavior goes against what Bernie stands for.\n\nI believe that Bernie stands for a fair system, even if it isn't in his best interest \u2014 but I can't see a way in which him staying in the race after Hillary wins more than 50% of the pledged delegates is consistent with his view that the superdelegates corrupt our democracy.

Even though Trump himself is a billionaire and has some SuperPACs, the majority of his campaign is self-financed. Wouldn't this mean Hillary Clinton would owe a lot of favors once she becomes president?\n\n\nAdditionally, the Email scandal does not look good for Clinton.

            "selftext": "Lifelong, and self-admittedly further right, Republican voter here trying to think tactically for 2020. Trump scares the shit out of me because I'm convinced he's a liberal feigning conservatism in order to get elected. The only thing he is all that conservative about is the wall, and we don't really have an issue with illegal immigration in Wisconsin, so it really doesn't bother me. His election, I believe, would derail our party and change us fundamentally for the worse, possibly for decades. I am a Scott Walker supporter and, barring Walker or the Pope explicitly saying \"Ralph, vote for Trump,\" I'm not about to ignore what Trump said about our state or my governor during the campaign.\n\nI had thought about voting Libertarian and was going to do so, but then I realized that, if they do well enough to get 5%, that'll hurt us in the 2020 general. The only time a liberal won our governor's office since the early 80's in Wisconsin was because a Libertarian stole otherwise rightfully Republican votes. I don't want a repeat of that nationally, but I can't in good conscience vote for a man who will ruin our party. As sickening as it sounds, my only real option aside from my voting might be to vote for a Democrat, but I'm having trouble with that.\n\nOn to my big questions then.\n\nWill Clinton be okay with not getting any Supreme Court picks through, or would she try to pull a FDR? I refuse to hand our state back over to the Democrats and we have several cases in the legal system that could do just that.\n\nWill Clinton find some way to end the Second Amendment? What are her plans to do so? How long would they take? Would states have a chance to act independently or would she try taking our guns away at the national level?\n\nIs she actually Christian?\n\nI've heard conflicting reports on her stance on abortion. Would she allow us to place our own state level restrictions and bans, or will she try to expand it?\n\nWould she sign a repeal of Obamacare?\n\nAs long as we retain control of the Courts, I think can tolerate 4 years in exchange for hopefully Scott Walker or Paul Ryan for 8. Ideally, we'd see another Tea Party style surge in 2018 which would help us take/keep more states going into redistricting. The last thing we need is Trump causing a reverse wave and putting Democrats in Governorship positions in the states we took in 2010. If we might lose the Court/Wisconsin, I don't really know what to do. I apologize if any of this sounds rude. I honestly can't stand the fact that I'm even THINKING of voting for a lib, let alone a Clinton, so it's hard to keep my language clean. Thanks for any clarification you can give in advance!\n\nEdit: I guess I'll be hesitantly waiting until the election and, in a worst case scenario, voting for Clinton. Thanks for helping me talk this out. I sure as hell don't like her and I'll ideally be voting for Scott Walker as a write in, but it's good to know a lot of my worries aren't completely justified. They are justified, but not to their fullest worst case levels.",

            "selftext": "This election has/will have two major candidates, Trump and Clinton. \n\nTo me, Clinton has held many positions but with very little to show for it. No major legislation as a senator and a foreign policy that was unremarkable at best. I don't doubt she's a policy expert and probably makes a very very ideal adviser. However, her decision-making skills and general likability really make me question her effectiveness as a President.\n\nI think Trump's past year speaks for itself on why he shouldn't be president.\n\nThis leaves many people in the position of voting for the lesser of two evils. The argument is often that a vote for a third party is a wasted vote and helps the greater evil win. That may be a fine argument if you live in Florida or Ohio, but in reality, your vote doesn't matter at all if you live in MA, NY, VT, OK, MS, AL, and so forth. In any solidly blue or red state, your vote for the lesser of two evils has no impact at all. **It doesn't matter that you voted.** However, it could matter if you voted for a third party. Federal funding for parties is based off of the popular vote (above 5% needed). It also drums up much needed awareness of these other parties and could help spread the word about them.\n\nWhy is Trump running on a GOP ticket? Because its a waste of time to run as anything besides the two major parties. The rules and odds are stacked so far against them that the easiest way into the Oval Office is by running on a major ticket. Bernie Sanders, a longtime independent has also shown this. If he was reasonably able to run on a third party ticket, then I'm sure he would and could avoid the Democratic Party's hoops. People talk about the primaries like they're rigged, but they're not. This is an independent organization that has chosen Hillary Clinton long ago. Bernie almost broke it like Trump did, but it is VERY difficult. \n\nVoting for a third party is voting against this system. It's voting against the status-quo Hillary and is voting to give people like Trump or Bernie a real chance **without destroying the central parties**. This is the real strategic vote, at least for blue/red staters. If enough people voted with this mentality, it would likely not alter the outcome and provide a better situation for future elections. \n\nFringe, populist candidates will be forced into the two \"mainstream\"/centrist parties, radicalizing them because there is no other outlet for them. Their supporters are fanatics and much more vocal than the centrists and will inherently take over the parties by radicalizing them through hatred of the other side. Hillary Clinton, a \"project\" groomed for 30 years for this situation is only barely beating an elderly man that came out of nowhere. This will continue to happen to greater and greater extents unless there's another outlet.\n\n_____\n\n> *Hello, users of CMV! This is a footnote from your moderators.

Most of my main argument comes from this article: http://www.democracyintegrity.org/ElectoralFraud/just-doing-the-math.html   The exit polls have been consistently off in favor of Hillary Clinton. The author found that it was a 1 in 77 billion chance that this happened organically. The article also found that the discrepancy between the exit polls and the vote totals was greater in larger districts. He says this is evidence of fraud because people who rig the vote tend to do it more in larger districts because it is easier to hide.

            "selftext": "So a just a few weeks ago, this would have been aimed at Sanders supporters. Now, it's clear the same support is flying behind Jill Stein or Gary Johnson.\n\nThese candidates will not win. Period. There is no historical evidence for their victory. There is no practical or probable path that leads them to win. \n\nSupporting them--voting for them especially--is a strategically bone-headed move for either end of the ideological spectrum. Let's say a Jill Stein voter is at 0 and Johnson at 100 along an itherwise meaningless number line. Then--for the sake of argument--we put Clinton at 25 and Trump at 75. Voting for Stein makes ti more likely that Trump--who is farther away from your 0 than Clinton is--will win. So instead of an ideological net loss of only 25, you have an ideological net loss of 75. \n\nSo at most what you're holding on to is ideological purity, or principles beholden to your beliefs. What you are losing, however, is the net gain towards those beliefs. \n_____\n\n> *Hello, users of CMV! This is a footnote from your moderators. We'd just like to remind you of a couple of things.

            "selftext": "**Background** \n\nIn response to the terrorist shooting in Orlando early Sunday morning, a proposal to prevent people on the No-Fly list from buying firearms has resurfaced after similar legislation failed in both houses of Congress in December\n\nOn December 3, Sen. Feinstein's [S.Amdt. 2910](https://www.congress.gov/amendment/114th-congress/senate-amendment/2910) was killed by procedural vote and Rep. Peter King's [H.R.1076](https://www.congress.gov/bill/114th-congress/house-bill/1076?q={%22search%22%3A[%22peter+king%22]}) did not receive enough signatures to force a vote. Each was titled, \"Denying Firearms and Explosives to Dangerous Terrorists Act of 2015\" and sought to:\n\n> [permit] the Attorney General to deny the transfer of firearms or the issuance of firearms and explosives licenses to known or suspected dangerous terrorists.\n\nNew proposals are even more specific, alternately using the [No-Fly List](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/No_Fly_List) or the Terrorist Watch List (officially, the [Terrorist Screening Database](https://www.fbi.gov/about-us/nsb/tsc) ) to determine who should not be allowed to buy firearms.\n\n**My view**\n\nMine is a simple view: The No-Fly List is maintained under the sole purview of the executive branch without jury trials and owning a gun is an enumerated Constitutional right. The former does not meet the level of scrutiny to withhold the latter. Thus, such a statute or executive order would fall to a Constitutional challenge.\n\n* *False positives.* The list contains a number of false positives, potentially having included Sen. Ted Kennedy and Yusuf Islam (nee Cat Stevens) at different times, meaning that not only can you be denied for your own suspected terrorist leanings; you can also be denied for the leanings of those with a similar name to you.\n* *Opacity.* The fact that I had to say, \"Potentially\" in the last section shows another problem with the No-Fly List. There are conflicting reports of whether either was actually on it or merely inconvenienced in some other way. We don't know that we're on it until we're denied and even then, we don't know when\n* *Limited appeal process.* Given that we don't necessarily know why we're on the list, it's difficult to fight our way off it.\n\nLike I said; simple, right? Of course, I'm not a lawyer and many who are pushing for this aren't just lawyers, but also savvy politicians who understand the repercussions of enacting something like this only to get it shot down... hence, my doubts. \n\nNote also that I'm not saying that such a ban would be ineffective or effective. Rather, I'm primarily concerned with whether it could hold up to a lawsuit if enacted.\n\n**TL;DR** The No-Fly List is maintained under the sole purview of the executive branch without jury trials and owning a gun is an enumerated Constitutional right. The former does not meet the level of scrutiny to withhold the latter.\n\nChange my view.\n\n*Edit: Clarified that it would be unconstitutional if a statute or executive order were enacted. Obviously, if we went through the long process of adding an amendment to the Constitution, it would be by definition Constitutional*\n\n\n_____\n\n> *Hello, users of CMV!

            "selftext": "I live in the US and given as how it is an election year, I think it is interesting to look back upon what happened over the course of this year.  In doing so you begin to realize that throughout the primaries, a significant amount of media discussion was about momentum, particularly in the Bernie Sanders campaign. A large amount of the discussion was about whether or not Sanders could amount enough momentum to overtake Clinton, while others said Clinton would have too much momentum to be overtaken etc etc. \n\nPoint in hand, the key word here is momentum. I strongly believe elections should not be based off of momentum and who has the advantage in delegates starting off, but rather the policies, the character, the beliefs, and views of the candidates instead. \n\nHowever, this is something that easily can be remedied by the implementation of a one day national primary. \n\nNow, one might bring up the argument that candidates should visited states one but one before voting so the candidates can become better acquainted with the people, but this is an argument of the past. In today's world we are all connected by media, where's in times past candidates could not be seen giving a speech in one state by the entire nation. The united states has changed in the past to keep up with modernism, so why can't it do so again? With this argument beside, a one day primary doesn't mean the candidates don't have to visit individual states: it means that candidates should go to each individual state to get on a personal level with the people then have a voting day where people can vote without being pressured and influenced by the decisions and views of others. \n\n\nThere may be underlying reasons that the US keeps the primary system the way it does, and I don't know everything, so I post this here to learn. \n",

            "selftext": "Talking about Bernie specifically; he is from Vermont, ffs. How many deaths would an \"assault weapons\" ban in Vermont prevent, even if 100% successful?\n\nWell, in [2010](https://www.fbi.gov/about-us/cjis/ucr/crime-in-the-u.s/2010/crime-in-the-u.s.-2010/tables/10tbl20.xls) (most recent report I am aware of) it would have prevented 1 or no deaths. Because we don't know if the SINGLE death by rifles that year were committed by a tacticool rifle with a folding stock and forward grip, or a less deadly alternative like the 995 (the Columbine gun). More people were killed by hands and feet than rifles in Vermont. Vermont has no restrictions on guns beyond what is federally prescribed. It also has the lowest gun homicide rate in the country.\n\nI am sure that Bernie is aware of all of this. I am sure that he knows that \"assault weapons\" are NOT used by the military, despite suggesting quite the opposite, I am sure that he knows that a ban on cosmetic aspects will have little to no effect on crime, like it didn't last time it was passed. I am sure he knows that practically every rifle owner is a law abiding citizen who would never kill with it outside of self defense, and yet he supports the ban anyways.\n\nI could make similar arguments for his (and Clinton's and most dems) about their support of banning standard capacity magazines, and creating a process that can arbitrarily removing gun rights without due process or appeal, etc.\n\nI believe it is pandering to the voting base, and they do not actually believe in what they propose on a personal level.

            "selftext": "Hillary Clinton often positions herself as an incrementalist or and a belief in gradualism.  But I'm curious where she actually wants progress to be made.\n\nSo my basic assumption here, to actually be incremental progress you have to be more progressive then your predecessor, in this case, Obama.\n\nBut when you look at her positions, on the majority of the issues, she is at the same position or just right to Obama.  I should note, this is where I judge her and Obama's positions, not where they officially stand.   You can try to convince me that my rankings are incorrect though.\n\n\nIssues where Hillary is more progressive then Obama:\n\n * Minimum wage increase\n * Gun Control\n * Student Loans\n\n_____\n\nIssues where Obama and Hillary line up:\n\n * Healthcare (Obamacare/Medicaid/Vaccines)\n * Free Trade\n * Immigration\n * Women's Rights (Abortion;PP Funding;Gender Pay/Diversity)\n * Voter Rights\n * Patriot Act/Mass Surveillance\n\n_____\n\n\nIssues where Hillary is more conservative then Obama:\n\n * Campaign finance\n * American imperialism/interventionism\n * Israeli/Palestine Conflict\n * Wall street deregulation\n * Prison Privatization\n * LGBT Rights\n * Drug/Pot legalization\n * Welfare reform\n * Death Penalty\n * Net Neutrality\n * Taxation\n * Torture\n * Criminal Justice Reform\n\n_____\n\n\nAs people change my views, I'll reward deltas and update the lists.\n\nCurrent scores:\n\n * Better then Obama: 3\n * Same as Obama: 6\n * Worst then Obama: 13\n\n_____\n\n> *Hello, users of CMV!

            "selftext": "I believe that Hillary Clinton is unfit for the presidency because she is corrupt, a liar, and a hypocrite.\n\n1. Hillary Clinton is corrupt. She or her husband routinely [have taken money from companies](http://downtrend.com/robertgehl/oops-bill-clinton-says-he-accidentally-took-500000-from-algeria-during-key-arms-negotiation-with-state-department), that they then go on to give government contracts. [One of her largest donors was given a spot on the nuclear advisory board, with no experience at all.](http://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2016/06/clinton-had-donor-as-nuclear-security-adviser.html) She will not release her speech transcripts, which hints at the fact that Hillary may have told them something that she doesn't want to get out. Whether it be corruption or something else; she is hiding something.\n\n\n\n2. Hillary Clinton is a hypocrite and a liar. She takes huge sums of cash from wall street, and then says that she is going to breakup the banks. She says that she is a women's rights activist, and yet takes millions from countries like Saudi Arabia. I haven't even mentioned Hillary's flip flopping on all sorts of her campaign issues, and described in [this](http://imgur.com/Ls3B6n1) image. You can see her whole platform change in response to Bernie Sanders. She seems to say anything to get elected.\n\nBased on all this, how can people support her? The facts are right there, and yet Hillary continues to get many votes. Is there something that I'm missing? It seems as if the second she gets in office she will support the big donors that she has pledged against. Throughout this whole thing, I haven't yet talked about Hillary's email scandal. She held secret government files on a server that was *hacked multiple times.* If someone could show me the reasons to support Hillary that would be great.\n\n\n_____\n\n> *Hello, users of CMV!

            "selftext": "I think the email scandal shows she is either completely inept and/or corrupt, both of which are massive red flags for voting someone for president.\n\nBroken down into events:\n\nHRC + colleagues use unencrypted Blackberrys against the advice of the state department (http://www.nytimes.com/2016/05/26/us/politics/state-department-hillary-clinton-emails.html?_r=0) This shows a lack of respect toward the State Department, a lack of understanding of basic technology, or disregard for public security: any of these is a serious red flag for presidency. We know that she was aware of the State Department's advice: https://www.washingtonpost.com/investigations/how-clintons-email-scandal-took-root/2016/03/27/ee301168-e162-11e5-846c-10191d1fc4ec_story.html By using the Blackberrys she may have also been simply trying to maximize her personal convenience at the expense of national security, a massive red flag. This article also corroborates this idea: http://lawnewz.com/high-profile/we-now-know-more-about-why-clinton-set-up-private-server-and-its-sketchyy/\n\nThe article above summarizes my guess better than I could have: \n\nSome cybersecurity analysts view the short turnaround between the denial from the NSA and the decision to use the private network as evidence of Clinton and her team showing a blatant disregard for security protocols.\n\n\u201cIt is contempt for the system, contempt for the rules that are designed to protect the exact kind of information that was exposed through this email set up,\u201d cybersecurity analyst Morgan Wright told Fox News.\"\n\nHRC skirts the Freedom of Information Act by claiming she mixed personal and work-related emails. If the latter is true, this is at the least foolishness. If the former is true, she is lying. Either outcome here is a big red flag: http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2016/apr/03/hillary-clinton/hillary-clinton-i-have-now-put-out-all-my-emails/\n\nHRC violates Federal Records Act: http://www.npr.org/sections/itsallpolitics/2015/04/02/396823014/fact-check-hillary-clinton-those-emails-and-the-law by having her staff delete emails off the server which she claimed were personal emails, even though the law required her to release any emails on that private server to the State Department.\n\nAllow me to assume the position of HRC. Let's assume that I have no integrity and simply want to maximize personal convenience. I will look for the most experienced people possible for my private server, right? People with degrees in computer security combined with decades of industry experience? No, HRC doesn't do this: https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/fbi-looks-into-security-of-clintons-private-e-mail-setup/2015/08/04/2bdd85ec-3aae-11e5-8e98-115a3cf7d7ae_story.html\n\nLet's assume that I, HRC, do have integrity, but don't have any common sense. As shown above, it has been confirmed that I knew about their advice, so this doesn't seem to be a possibility.\n\nFinally, let's assume that I am ignorant of Freedom of Information Act, etc. Wait- this is completely unreasonable. The Secretary of State of the United States of America should know the laws better than almost anyone else.\n\nTo summarize: the email scandal seems to show that HRC lacks the necessary integrity/common sense/knowledge of the law to be president.",

I was also surprised at the ignorance about the [Bush White House e-mail scandal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bush_White_House_email_controversy), where federal employees were using georgewbush.com, rnchq.org, and gwb43.com e-mail servers for government work. Clinton apparently thought that sending e-mails to people @state.gov would be enough for record keeping compared to everyone being on private e-mail.\n\nThe thing about attacks is that they are routine on the internet - phishing e-mails, port searching, automatic scans for private keys, etc etc etc. None of these constitute a legitimate hack in the sense of  a foreign power stealing information. \n\nI would like to see actual evidence that classified material was taken.\n\n_____\n\n> *Hello, users of CMV!

Several of my friends are buying tickets-which are free and are limited to two (2) per purchase-and then, they planto protest the event by not showing up. That's right. Fill the arena with empty seats. To me, this seems extremely immature. Sure, it may seem funny if you don't like Trump but I know they wouldn't have liked conservatives or Hillary Clinton supporters doing it for a potential Bernie Sanders rally. I don't like Donald Trump and have no interest in voting for him in the general election, but shouldn't as many people as possible be able to see him if they want to? What if there are undecided voters who want to listen to all possible options? Doesn't reserving tickets take away from people who actually want to see what he has to say? What harm does Donald Trump pose by visiting our city? I get that people hate Donald Trump and want to protest the event. But to do so this way seems wrong. Is there something I'm missing here?\n\n_____\n\n> *Hello, users of CMV! This is a footnote from your moderators. We'd just like to remind you of a couple of things.

            "selftext": "In most recent presidential elections, the third party candidates have only garnered one or two percentage points of the popular vote and no electoral votes. As a result, most people in the United States write off third parties in elections and pollsters often don't include them in their polls.\n\nI believe that *in this election cycle* these polls are inherently inferior to those that include Gary Johnson (and Jill Stein) alongside Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump as candidates because they do not accurately represent the choices that voters will face on election day.\n\nGary Johnson is on track to be on the ballot in all 50 states and in Real Clear Politics' aggregated polling is consistently drawing [eight percent of the vote](http://www.realclearpolitics.com/epolls/2016/president/us/general_election_trump_vs_clinton_vs_johnson_vs_stein-5952.html)\n  from Clinton and Trump, with a further four percent going to Stein. \n\nI'm not one of those people who thinks that Johnson has a chance of winning the election by some crazy hail Mary, but I do think that his candidacy fundamentally alters the electoral landscape, and this needs to be accounted for in order to produce accurate polling information. Nationally, ~10% is a huge chunk of the vote to not go to one of the major parties, and I'm sure in some states the percentage will be higher. Swing states in this election (and possibly even some lean/safe states) will be won and lost in a margin closer than 10%. Hillary Clinton may lose a state or two to Trump she otherwise would have won if Johnson hadn't been in the race or vice versa. \n\nIf pollsters only offer voters two choices, Trump and Hillary, there is no way for their information to be entirely accurate. \n\nNote: the reason I am tentative on the necessity of Stein being included is that she is generally polling at a lower number and to my knowledge is less likely to appear on every ballot. I generally think it would be a good idea for her to be included in every poll, but it is not strictly necessary, especially in states where she is unlikely to appear on the ballot.\n_____\n\n> *Hello, users of CMV!

            "selftext": "Today's FBI press conference explicitly states (among other things) that Hillary Clinton would not be charged with a criminal offence because she was not aware she was breaking the law. Awareness of the law is not generally required to convict someone from a crime and the only reason she has gotten away with it is because she is too powerful and well connected for members of law enforcement to risk their careers going after her. On top of this, her position in government would have explicitly made her aware of the seriousness of these offences and the consequences of not respecting the sensitive nature of the information she had access to. Finally, a lesser employee who committed these acts would be fired and never work in government again for such obvious mishandling of this information. Therefore, it is my opinion that Hilary Clinton has very clearly today been shown to be not subject to the same regulations as a less well connected, powerful and rich american and by extension the citizens of america do not live in a nation where rule of law can be expected to protect the common man from government corruption.\n\n_____\n\n> *Hello, users of CMV!

This means no less than Obama endorsing Hillary Clinton for president, **and using his powers as current President to help her achieve that goal.** I don't think this has ever been done before. Maybe Obama is doing it because he really really thinks Donald Trump would be a horrible president, but regardless of your feelings about Trump, one candidate having the ear of the sitting president is a huge disproportionate advantage, essentially crowning a successor like a medieval kingdom. All it does is further confirm the United States is an oligarchy of the rich and powerful, with a populace manipulated to support pre-selected views.\n\n_____\n\n> *Hello, users of CMV!

As a black man I've been exposed to a plethora of racial discussion through the years and I have come to the conclusion that diversity has done nothing to improve the country. \n\nDisclaimer: I'll start by saying that I think every race is equal and capibale of equal greatness if they set their mind to it and if they unite as one nation the sky is the limit.\nOver the past hundreds of years racial tension has always existed here and the recent few years have only further exposed this. The current climate today is HEAVILY contentious and is quickly turning into a highly regressive system; anybody who has a different viewpoint to their neighbor is called any number of terms such as \"coon\", \"cracker\",\"straight white man\" and all that meaningless bunkum. I've even seen my own people attempt to close the conversation by asserting that simply people who are white or simply non-black are unable to talk about the issue nor able to take part in non-native culture(also known as \"Cultural appropriation\"). Race has left America so balkanized that we are beginning to focus on attacking each other ignoring issues within our own communities(61 people we're shot in my hometown Chicago last holiday weekend and NO ONE seems to care) and keeping POLITICIANS in line(The top candidates are Trump and Clinton, something is wrong). When a people are divided they are weakened and are therefore unable to address issues to full capabilities. If ALL of the life loving americans, regardless of race would simply come together and solve issues together we would be a MUCH stronger society. I''m tired of the racial tension here but until the culture of America changes it will remain a divided country and in my eyes a divided country is a breaking country.\n\nWe either hang together or simply hang.\n\nP.S sorry for the broken language.\n_____\n\n> *Hello, users of CMV!

            "selftext": "I will explain the reasoning behind my view below and I will be open to change.  I have watched the Comey hearing earlier today and I think he alluded to the matter of intent and gross negligence.  Those words were uttered several times during the hearing.   Also, it seems that negligence is behavior opposite a person's normal behavior.   Comey even admitted that Hillary's use of the server was negligent and not normal behavior for her position.   But even Comey had said that it would be difficult to prove malicious intent.  Did Clinton ever believe that what she was doing was criminal?  Did she ever feel it was wrong or could harm the country or her office?  I think yes to all of those.  But how could Comey suggest to the DoJ there is an actual case.     By setting up the server where only Clinton could control and using that email server exclusively is clearly malicious and negligent.  \n\nHere is a fact: \n\n\"During Clinton's tenure as United States Secretary of State, she had exclusively used her family's private email server for official communications, rather than official State Department email accounts maintained on federal servers. Those official communications included thousands of emails that would later be marked classified by the State Department retroactively.\" \n\nThere were thousands of emails on the server related to government business.  Her aides and her lawyers, who didn't have the proper access, deleted emails.\n\nAlso, in the Comey hearing, He mentioned David Petraeus.  He mentioned, that is an almost perfect trial that should have gone to trial.  David Patraeus gave classified information to his mistress and biographer.  I will repeat that.   David Patraeus gave classified information to his mistress and biographer, he was charged with a crime.   One might argue that the scope of David's crime was far worse than Clinton's.  But I believe that the opposite is true.   Remember, thousands of emails were found on the server.  And even Clinton's aides deleted emails.  I assume to cover up something.     What if Bill Clinton had access to her emails.  Or other reporters.  Maybe they had their own accounts.   Or maybe accounts could have been created.  Or maybe reporters could have had direct access to Clinton's email.  The reporters could just walk down to the basement  and peek at the server.     I guess the same argument could be made for her using state department email, but she wouldn't have had as much access.\n\nOnce again, Comey said that David Patraeus had committed a crime.  And he didn't believe Hillary did so.  Let's look at what David did.  Basically, he gave classified information to a biographer.  (Also may have secretly tried to hide that information).  Hillary Clinton setup an entire \"system\" that existed to where she could circumvent FOIA requests.  It wouldn't have the same several of secret as  a state department email.  For example, she probably couldn't delete en masse a body of emails, delete thousands of email.  David was caught sending information to the biographer.  Is it possible that Clinton could mask the recipients of the emails she sent.  We know thousands of emails were deleted.  Maybe thousands of government, classified emails were sent to thousands of reporters but cleverly masked.  It was her system, it seems that it would be easier manipulate than through the state department email.   What was David's intent by giving classified information to a biographer?  Maybe the information would enrich his life through book sales, only  a small number would have access to that information.  Well, what is Hillary's intent?  She had access to thousands of emails, some deemed classified.   And who really had access to that information.  Isn't it a far worse crime than the Patraeus crime, we know that there was one recipient in the Patraeus case.  How many people actually had access to Clinton's server? Did she give out access to her email?  With a state department email system, her government email, access may have been more severely limited.\n\nAnd then there is aspect of classification.  Unauthorized and Mishandling of classified information is criminal.  Comey said, that Hillary Clinton should have known that as a top State Department official, she would handle classified communication.  She setup an entire email system that she could have complete control over.  \n\nBased on those points, I believe Clinton's behavior was clearly criminal.\n_____\n\n> *Hello, users of CMV!

            "selftext": "I'm generally a progressive voter and vote Democratic.  Obama received my votes in past two presidential elections.\n\nColbert, Fallon, Daily Show, Wilmore, Conan, etc.  For the past year I've recorded and watched all of their opening monologues. I read CNN and USAToday among others for news.  The unifying theme of the monologues and commentary when the focus is on Trump is to describe an incompetent or a racist or an incompetent racist.  \n\nA recent example from last week is the focus on Trump's seemingly antisemitic use of the star of David in an anti-Clinton tweet.  The joke is fair game, I see the resemblance in the star.  However at the same time the Trump-star made news, the FBI recommended that Clinton's security clearance be revoked.  The monologues and headlines gave mention to this, but the consensus  is that Clinton is a viable candidate.  \n\nOn the Clinton side, the US government is recommending that a presidential candidate's security clearance be revoked.  On the Trump side, one of his aids posted a seemingly antisemitic tweet.  The spin on Trump was that he is a racist, which is a hugely negative impactful statement especially in light of the recent police brutality.  The spin on Clinton is that she made an error, which is a severe understatement in light of the US Government literally labeling Clinton as someone not to be trusted with Government secrets.\n\nThe above example is enough for Media to lose a sense of legitimacy.  One candidate's mishap is aggrandized at the expense of his candidacy's viability, while the other candidate's overt transgressions receive cursory mention.  My explanation of this dichotomy is the large level of financial backing the networks receive from the companies that back the Clinton campaign.  \n\n\n_____\n\n> *Hello, users of CMV!

            "selftext": "CMV: Most jihadist groups are creations of the west.  Here's a summary of facts that led me to this opinion.  I want to CMV because I'd rather believe groups like ISIS are just generic bad guys like comic book villains, but I think it's more likely these are Frankenstein monsters we've created, now out of our control.  \n\n\n- 1970's, Henry Kissinger makes a deal with OPEC countries: we would develop Arab infrastructure and use taxpayer subsidies to purchase oil from Arab gulf states\n- Arab gulf states would then take the oil, and reinvest in U.S. public debt as treasury securities.  They would also use U.S. taxpayer money to buy weapons from private companies (Boeing, Lockheed, etc).  \n- Around this same time, the Federal Reserve stopped backing the printed dollar with gold.  \n- The Gulf Arab States were now America's greatest ally against the Soviet Union - they prop up fiat currency by only allowing energy purchases in the printed dollar (backed by nothing except public debt investment in the United States)\n- Neither Iran nor Iraq accept this detail.  \n\n- First experiment with arming jihadist groups: Afghanistan.  Zbigniew Brzezinski meets with Osama bin Laden.  Islamic Wahabism is the perfect religion to recruit for these wars.  It's a religion that comes from violence, very intolerant of other beliefs, and never went through a renaissance.  Very easy to recruit radicals for political purposes.  The entire experience is a success, mujahideen defeat Afghani communists and godless Soviet Union aggression.  \n\nOnto Libya and the CMV: \n\n- 2003, Gadaffi gives up WMD programs\n- 2004-2008, Gadaffi signs various international infrastructure development deals\n- 2007 - General Wesley Clark reciting a conversation: \u201cWe\u2019re going to take out seven countries in 5 years, starting with Iraq, and then Syria, Lebanon, Libya, Somalia, Sudan and, finishing off, Iran\u201d \n\n- 2009-2011 Hillary Clinton + Libya.  John McCain + Syria.  These are the watershed moments\n\n- 2009 John McCain tweet: \"Late evening with Col. Qadhafi at his \"ranch\" in Libya - interesting meeting with an interesting man. 2:42 PM - 15 Aug 2009\n- 2010 - Gadaffi announces African Union currency backed by gold.  A challenge to the franc currency used in that region (which is backed by the French Treasury).  In fact, it's a challenge to the entire world banking system, which trades in the U.S. dollar - fiat currency backed by nothing (except public treasury debt).  \n- 2010 Gadaff and King Abdullah of Saudi Arabia get into an argument on live TV over who's a \"colonial puppet\".  King Abdullah tells Gadaffi his \"grave lies before you\" (i.e) the King of Saudi Arabia just told Gadaffi he's a dead man on live TV.  \n- 2011 - Arab Spring.  John McCain tweet.  \"Qaddafi on his way out, Bashar al Assad is next.\" 5:25 PM - 21 Aug 2011\n\nConclusion: \n\n- al Qaeda type groups armed by the Saudis and backed by NATO planes destroy Libyan infrastructure and rout the Libyan army.  The Libyan national bank is dissolved and immediately replaced with an international private bank that accept western currencies and private investors.  Libyan oil and Libyan water is now available to overseas investors.  Libya is now free to develop these resources by taking loans from the IMF or World Bank.   \n- Hillary Clinton has 30,000 deleted emails.  It's a 2016 election issue, but no one brings up details.  I believe those deleted emails from her time as SOS are related to NATO actions in Libya, and the gold dinar threat to French banking interests.  \n\n*So CMV: I believe almost every jihadist group is formed by western interests to combat the real American enemy: Russian backed nationalist or socialist dictators that seek to undermine the U.S. dollar.  \n\n*So CMV: I want to believe war on terror is about groups like ISIS just being \"bad guys\", and us being \"good guys\", not about oil or fiat currency.    \n\nDisclaimer: If there's no world utopia, American power is the better alternative to Russian or Chinese.  I'm not naive to realities of thug governments, from Putin to Saddam.  \n\n_____\n\n> *Hello, users of CMV! This is a footnote from your moderators.

I'm a socialist, and I'm SO happy that he's brought more progressive ideals into the spotlight. I truly wish that he'd won - but he didn't.\n\nMany die-hard Sanders supporters, including many of my friends on Facebook (the reason I want my view changed - I don't want to lose their friendship) will vote Green or abstain from voting because they think Clinton is extremely corrupt. Of course corruption is bad. But the vague idea of corruption is not going to influence my day to day life. We are going to be influenced by the policies that these people make. I'd love Bernie Sanders to come in and force through universal health care and tuition-free college for everyone. But Bernie Sanders does not have a way to win this election. So, now we're at the crossroads between two ideals: those of Clinton, and those of Trump.\n\nClinton has agreed on a $15 minimum wage, LGBT rights, and less expensive schooling. Just like Bernie. Our alternative is a person who has talked about abolishing the minimum wage because it detriments the rich. Someone who thinks climate change is a hoax propagated by China. Someone who talks about women alternatively as though they're either slabs of fuck-meat or snakes waiting to bite.\n\nI wish that Bernie Sanders were going to compete against Donald Trump, and that I could sensibly vote for him in November. But he won't, and I can't. So currently, my thought is that I should instead use my vote to carry on his ideals. Use my vote to say that YES, I think that LGBT people matter. YES, my future is going to be directly impacted by climate change. YES, everyone deserves a good education, and the US is lagging behind every other first-world country in that department.\n\nI think I should be supporting Clinton - not because I'm some big Hillary fan, but because she is the best vehicle to see Sanders' movement succeed.\n_____\n\n> *Hello, users of CMV!

            "selftext": "US politics was founded on compromise; It's how our republic is designed to work. If you firmly believed in Bernie's message, it is understandable that you will be reluctant to vote for HRC until she is able to come to the left on some core issues. However, how is voting for Trump going to bring Clinton toward more progressive policies? An emotional vote 'against the system' is illogical, childish and selfish in my view. \n\n\nBernie's campaign started a social movement that was almost able to beat a rigged Democratic party. It would be a shame for his supporters to suddenly vote against everything he believed in because he lost the nomination. CMV. \n_____\n\n> *Hello, users of CMV!

            "selftext": "Not all cops need to carry lethal firearms.  I don't think that a majority of cops in the United States should carry firearms.  Only a subset of cops that are specially trained, that have dealt with firearms before and have a certain level of experience should be able to carry firearms.   With the recent police involved shootings, police departments should determine if ALL of their cops should be able to kill an American citizen.\n\nMy recent view is mostly based on two recent shootings, I want to reference the Philando Castile and the Walter Scott  shooting.    Philando Castile was stopped for a traffic violation  and he told the officer that he had a license to carry a gun and at some point, he moved in a certain way, the officer shot and killed him.   He was initially stopped for some minor traffic violation and ended up dead.  We don't know all of the details.  But even before the details are out, it doesn't appear that Castile needed to be killed.  I argue that cops can and should carry other weapons but do they all have to be lethal?  For example, could the officer have used a tazer or pepperball or other weapon if he thought he was in danger.\n\nIn the Walter Scott case in South Carolina, Scott was running away from the officer and he was shot in the back.  Not all of the details are in, but it doesn't look like the cop should have used lethal force.  If this cop did NOT have access to a lethal weapon, maybe Scott would not have been killed.  Once again, if the cop had non-lethal weapon, could he still protect himself and avoid killing an American citizen even if the circumstances warrant such action?\n\nMy view is based on those two recent killings but there were also 1146 instances of death by cop in 2015 in the United States.  There were 229 deaths where the victim was unarmed.  This data is according to Guardian data below.  1146 seems high for a country with 300 million people.  There were 4 deaths in Sweden and 6 similar deaths in Germany based on 2012 data.  This is a lot lower number than in the US.  There are more shootings in the US than most of Europe.    Also, see the data below,\n\nhttp://www.theguardian.com/us-news/ng-interactive/2015/jun/01/the-counted-police-killings-us-database\n\nhttp://theconversation.com/why-do-american-cops-kill-so-many-compared-to-european-cops-49696\n\nhttps://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/298435/Police_use_of_firearms_Commons.pdf\n\nhttps://www.fbi.gov/about-us/cjis/ucr/crime-in-the-u.s/2012/crime-in-the-u.s.-2012/offenses-known-to-law-enforcement/expanded-homicide/expanded_homicide_data_table_14_justifiable_homicide_by_weapon_law_enforcement_2008-2012.xls\n\n\nMy view is also based on the idea that cops should be able to carry other types of weapons that will protect the officer but also protect others.  The article below references other forms of weapons that can be used at traffic stops that may be able to stop a person if a cop feels threatened.   They may use bean bags, impact projectiles, pepperballs or tazers.  It is 2016 and cops and military have access to advanced weaponry, I believe that they don't need to use only lethal forms of weapons. \n\nhttp://theconversation.com/why-do-american-cops-kill-so-many-compared-to-european-cops-49696\n\nAlso, I feel that cops CAN use lethal weapons in order to protect themselves and others.  SWAT teams should have access to sniper rifles, flashbang grenades and other lethal weapons.  I don't feel every cop during a traffic violation stop should carry lethal weapons.  Most of the young, seemingly inexperienced cops carry weapons.  As they are inexperienced do they understand how to handle a firearm properly?   Shouldn't that duty be given to more experienced officers.  Could that duty be given to officers in different situations, not just basic traffic violations?\n\nIf cops have access to other weapons and are better trained then I feel that fewer citizens will lose their lives.  The 1146 death number will go down but the public will also remain safe.   Many in Congress, Hillary Clinton and American citizens have advocated for cops to carry body cameras, I also hope that they advocate for the use of non-lethal weapons.\n_____\n\n\n> *Hello, users of CMV!

            "selftext": "Now that Hillary Clinton is definitely going to be a Democratic nominee, the best reason to vote for her that I heard is that she is not Donald Trump.\n\nOften, this argument centers around the next President nominating Supreme Court justices. Of course Trump has a bunch of idiotic policies that generally have no place in civilized society, such as racial profiling, extreme xenophobia, and more.\n\nWhile true, I do thing that the fear of Trump is exaggerated for two reasons.\n\nFirst, we do have confirmation for Supreme Court nominees, and if Trump nominates a judge from Idiocracy, Democrats still have sufficient numbers in Senate to filibuster the nominees. Trump has no popular support, so 2/3 of the country would cheer if they did it for the duration of the presidency.\n\nIncidentally, the same is true for Hillary. If she nominates someone who Republicans don't like, since she is so unpopular, Republicans could also filibuster her nominee for the duration of her presidency, and 2/3 of the country will cheer them on.\n\nSecondly, in terms of Trump idiotic policies, we don't really know what he expects to deliver. Obviously, he is playing to the stupidest, but does he seriously plan to build a wall, much less having Mexicans to pay for it? I seriously doubt it.\n\nAgain, given the fact that he has no base, he is extremely unpopular, there is probably a huge difference between what he claims, and what he could possibly hope to achieve.\n\nMost certainly, he is going to be a one term president, who will probably force a lot of soul searching inside the Republican party. Is this really so much worse that Hillary's candidacy - who actually does have base behind her, will probably last for two terms, and will continue the steady drift of Democrats to the right? I don't know.\n\nCMV, please!\n\n\n_____\n\n> *Hello, users of CMV! This is a footnote from your moderators. We'd just like to remind you of a couple of things.

There are now probably a million videos on YouTube you can watch that dissects Trump's words, how he appeals to the average citizen, how he gets so much free media attention, and how he is now decelerating his outrageous-ness. Trump is openly anti-establishment, and no billionaire or big corporate owner wants him as president. He speaks frankly about issues, and while it has been very reckless in the beginning, it's becoming proper as we near the general election. And he's clearly a successful businessman worth $4.5 billion dollars. You'd be a fool to underestimate him. I see so many millennials and teenagers thinking Trump is some dumb guy who's got no idea what he's doing after watching something like John Oliver's or Stephen Colbert's late night shows. The amount of bias in the media is obvious, they try to point out every small mistake, take things out of context, and treat jokes like actual statements. Some people are seriously saying he's Hitler reincarnate, without realizing how offensive it is to the actual victims of the holocaust. These are the same people who want safe spaces, trigger warnings, and advocate political correctness in comedy.\n\nMeanwhile, the only thing Hillary Clinton has been consistent in is her consistent change of policy, changing with time and audience. She's supposed to be the experienced, intelligent, reasonable candidate amongst the populist, radical others. Someone who has made serious decisions before and has the composure to do so. But as far as I've seen, the biggest point she's trying to sell is that she's a woman. You're right to think that this has been pointed out too many times, but she somehow manages to squeeze that message in all the time. She was undergoing an FBI investigation during this race, for being extremely careless with sensitive information. She lied so, so many times about her emails, whom she sent it to, what were the contents, how classified they were, whether she submitted all the emails, how many were work related, nearly everything, with a straight face. And yet, she's been released of all criminal charges, and no one seems to care about it. Do you really want someone like that as the president? She's switched her position about everything so many times, and maintains at the same time that her record about all that has been very consistent. What? It's like you should sit her down and make her watch everything she's said before.\n\nLook, I don't agree with Trump on many things, but it seems to me like Hillary Clinton is a cold-blooded liar who will do everything in her power to become the president. I think she would do much more crazy shit with that power than Trump can ever dream of, and get away with it as well. But so, so many people think Hillary is the better alternative, the better of two evils, if you will. Please explain to me why.\n\n_____\n\n> *Hello, users of CMV!

            "selftext": "Beyond the obvious fact that advertisements are a distraction, especially when driving; beyond the sexualized nature of 70% of ads, which our children witness; beyond the fact that advertisements are horrible wastes of public space, creating uglier and uglier sceneries to witness; what really aggravates me about public advertisements is their breach of human freewill!\n\nThe human mind absorbs everything in its environment, consciously and unconsciously. Everything we witness affects our future thoughts and emotions. Advertisements are explicitly designed to create emotional reactions in people, to get them to think positively about their product. A process known as emotional marketing. Consider apple, or coca-cola who uses props like Polar Bears in beautiful scenes to get people to emotionally connect with their products.\n\nCorrect me if I am wrong, but I thought freedom was a part of the constitution, and that our forefathers even warned us about banks and corporations taking over. I get that advertisements are the life-blood of capitalism, but human beings are not capitalist citizens, we are spiritual animals. We are being manipulated like cattle on the subtlest of ways to buy products we 1. Dont need 2. Are overpriced, and 3. Are not beneficial to our expansion as a collective.\n\nMany people do not see things as extreme as I do when it comes to advertisements and their breach of our freewill, but if we examine closely what freedom entails (I.e. the ability to think, feel and act without outside influence), advertisements restrict our freedom. They affect our thoughts, our emotions and our actions. \n\nOf course not every ad has the same impact on us, but when you are literally bombarded with over 100 a day, some do impact us. If ads were not effective, they would not be used. \n\nCMV: Advertisements breach our freewill, and should be banned from public spaces\n\nEDIT: It blows my mind how many of you defend the capitalist system we have in place and the advertisements used to perpetuate profits. You all deserve Hilary Clinton. Enjoy your days.\n\n",

My hope this election is that the third party turn out will be significant enough to show that it is possible for them to have a legitimate following, contrary to it only being the typical two parties dueling it out. If I did not live in Florida, my vote would be clear because most other states have voted the same party the last 100 years. However, if I decide to follow through, though improbable, this scenario could realistically happen: Donald Trump wins Florida by one vote, he wins Florida, and this wins him the presidency. This is why I believe a Third Party vote in a swing state is a wasted vote. Change my view. Please.\n\n_____\n\n> *Hello, users of CMV! This is a footnote from your moderators.

I was always the kind of person who thought if you didn't vote, you had no right to complain, and to make change we had to get together as citizens and put the right people in office. In all aspects of my life I tend to form strong opinions and believe in standing up for them.\n\nWhen Bush beat Gore in very dodgy circumstances, I knew the system was corrupt - but I still believed in voting, to try to make it better. When he won again, I felt disillusionment creeping in, but I told myself I should accept the majority vote even if it seemed misguided to me. I was heartened by candidate Obama, and deeply let down by President Obama - but I rationalized it by saying he was trying his best in a broken system.\n\nNow politics in the US seems so deeply corrupt. It's so obvious that's it's all controlled by moneyed interests, dominated by lies and propaganda, and is a total farce in terms of a true democracy. Maybe I am just getting older, but it honestly seems to have reached another level of awful.\n\nThe Democratic primary showed that the whole game is an insider's club, with no opportunity for the will of people to be expressed. I just read in the news that Clinton has picked a guy who is anti-abortion and pro free trade agreements as her running mate. I consider myself a leftist progressive, and I feel that the candidates put forward by the Democrats are so far away from my beliefs and values that I cannot support them.\n\nAnd that's not even getting into the fact that the Republicans have picked Trump. I can't bring myself to even listen to his acceptance speech (based on comments people have made about it) - it would just depress me and there's nothing I can do about it anyway. \n\nIn my opinion, Clinton is a better choice than Trump, but she's so incredibly distasteful to me, and got the nomination through so much dishonesty that I am very tempted to not even even care anymore. She represents everything I think is broken about the political system and I can't vote for her, even against a dangerous candidate like Trump.\n\nDemocracy is about accepting that you don't always get what you want, and that sometimes the majority wants to go against your preferences. But in this case, I don't feel like the results will in any way be a fair representation of what the American people actually want for their country, no matter who wins.\n\nThe idea of disengaging from politics and not voting is really depressing and disempowering for me. I hope someone can change my view.\n\n*Note: I know that many think voting in local elections does make a real difference, and I am open to that idea, but this CMV is specifically about voting in the presidential election in 2016.*",

Even in tyrannical oppressive One-Party States (or in oligarchic ones where some small pseudoparties still exist but the system is really rigged) the inner circles have this split - hierarchical authoritarian solutions are in a constant struggle with egalitarian laissez-faire attitudes...Any of the two wins the other side has ways to have a say - in demonstrations or other public forms  and they balance each other always. We cannot simply decide to do \"the right thing\". We always have two different sets of value and wordings - and in most cases there is some compromise worked out (checks and balances are implemented in the institutions for this reason.)

            "selftext": "I feel as the US election draws closer to November and the main party candidates are all but selected (as of next, they will be), a major arguing point among the Democratic electorate is that Hilary Clinton represents \"the lesser of two evils\". Those who are familiar with her political history know that she's gotten her hands dirty on more than one occasion, and as a result many people aren't comfortable voting for her, but are being persuaded to reconsider, because \"do you really want Donald Trump to be president?\"\n\nI disagree with this line of thinking, because the \"lesser of two evils\" vote only perpetuates the system whereby disenfranchised Democrats end up voting for candidates they really don't like that much, in order to keep candidates they really don't like out of office. The Democratic party can therefore keep running mediocre or right-leaning candidates under the Democratic label, and rely on the voter base to vote for them if they're less nutty than the Republican candidate. In this election cycle, Hilary is not the greatest choice for president, but many would agree that at least she's not Trump.\n\nWhat I think Democrats who don't like either Hilary or Trump should do is vote for a third party candidate. Of course, the risk of doing this is that if the left-leaning vote is split between two or three presidential candidates, then there is an increased chance that Trump will win the election. However, I think that this is a fair cost for the Democratic party to realize that they need to have a political platform that caters to voters not just as a foil to the Republican platform, but as a good political platform in itself. Especially after the recent DNC email leak, the Democrats need to learn the lesson that if you don't create the progressive platform that left-leaning Americans want, they will go somewhere else. CMV!\n\n-----\n\n**EDIT 1: On the argument that \"Nothing changed after Nader/Gore/Bush in 2000**\n\nSee my response [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/4udyh3/cmv_democratsvoters_who_dont_like_hilary_clinton/d5p4gmi). I argue that the 2000 election isn't comparable to this one either in terms of candidates or political/economic situation. It still remains possible therefore that a loss in this election could cause a shift to the left in the Democratic party, *especially* if they lose against the absurdity of Trump.\n_____\n\n> *Hello, users of CMV!

            "selftext": "In the wake of the emails we have legitimate proof that party leaders actively campaigned for Hillary and to the detriment of Bernie, for their own desires and outside the constraints of their roles. They actively engaged to suppress the expression of millions of American voters who have a right to self determite for whom they cast a vote. Not only that, they intentionally strove to cast those same Americans, who happen to be members of their own party, in a negative light.\n\nThe theme of the DNC seems to be unity, and yet we have blatant evidence that the command structure of the dnc had no intentions of listening, honoring, or respecting the wishes of nearly half of their own base. Not to mention what a shitshow the super delegates thing is. You mean to tell me our candidate was picked for us before I had a chance to hear at least one reasoned debate between a few select personalities and ideologies?\n\nAnyways it seems that he's going through with his endorsement of Hillary Clinton. Now as someone who is rather apolotical, I always kind of liked bernie, for the same reason the vast majority of my age group did. If he does go through with his endorsement, I can firmly say he will lose all of my support forever and always. It's simple. We have blatant evidence that everything he fought to change is happening. His support for Hillary is support for a corrupt system that actively disenfranchised him.\n\nNow I understand that he's worried Trump might take office. Frankly in the wake of these revelations that actuality is appearing more likely than ever, and with good reason. The establishment has been force feeding us Hillary through some mistaken sense that it's \"her turn\" as though the presidency were some kindergarten drinking fountain, and haven't allowed their base the basic right to elect their own leaders. \n\nSee the biggest difference between Trump and Clinton is ridiculously simple. Trump is a populist candidate who the people have supported against the wishes of the establishment, and Hillary is a candidate who the establishment are supporting against the wishes of the people. \n\nPersonally I'll never support Hillary or what she stands for. If anything I'm voting 3rd party this election for Gary Johnson at this point, in the hopes that if enough of us split the vote up maybe some room can be created for more parties to exist.\n\nI'll do this at the cost of a Trump presidency because imo it's better than a Clinton presidency. Of the two, at least Trump is honest. I feel he says what he actually believes, even if it is sexist or bigotted. I don't believe I've ever heard Clinton's true beliefs. I think she tries to play the game of thrones, and say what people want to hear, but she can't even feign affability or relatability well. See her attempts to dab, or talk about pokemon go.\n\nPersonally I think bernie should go third party for the hell of it. Because at this point he's got nothing left to lose. I'll never vote Democrat because frankly I find all this appalling. If Bernie continues to support them then he believes differently, and as such he loses credibility as just another cog in the system.",

I love his ideas and embraced his political revolution but when I saw that he didn't have a chance I changed my support to Clinton, because as much as I detest her puppetism and her moderate centrism (she actually isn't that centrist on a lot of issues), I knew she was infinitely better than Ted Cruz or Donald Trump on all the issues I supported Bernie for. I understand that the DNC is corrupt and if this was any other election, she'd be at least indicted, but this is extraordinary. More than 11 million people are at risk of being deported, and we are considering banning a religion from immigrating to the country. This isn't a joke. Principals have fucking flown out the window. I get it, you people like Jil Stein more, so do I, but she dosn't stand a chance in hell of actually getting elected, and same goes with Gary Johnson. As much as Clinton allegedly (and likely) played dirty to get elected, can we just bite the bullet here so we don't risk actually getting Donald Trump to be the 45th president? Understand why you support Sanders, understand that the likelihood of an overhaul of the system happening in the next few months is so unlikely that it does not warrant the risk that the destabilization exposes the country to (TRUMP). If you're a Trump supporter I understand how you can advocate for Clinton getting in trouble, but so many of the people who are upset at DWS are ex-Bernie supporters. I concede, you're correct, it's fucked, can we just move on because if we compared our fucked to their fucked, they're more fucked.\n\n",

            "selftext": "When I registered to vote at 18, I registered as a democrat without being fully aware of what the party platform was, and its recent history. I knew I agreed with democrats more than republicans, and decided I was a democrat. I'm 24 now, and have learned a lot since then. I have also realized since then that I am very far left of the Democratic party.\n\nDemocracy should be about having a voice for your opinions, and having a two party system keeps many people voting for what they would consider the lesser of two evils instead of voting for someone they actually agree with. I'm far left of the Democratic party, and think Hillary Clinton is doing a lot of things I find morally wrong. I have read through her website multiple times, and disagree with a lot of what she wants to do and why she wants to do it.\n\nDonald Trump seems like he would be a horrible president, and is way too vague when it comes to what he wants to do. Even with the vagueness, I strongly disagree with his plans if he becomes the president. \n\nDemocracy in the US has been a two party system for almost its entire history, and I think that's horrible. I'm far left of both parties and would rather vote my conscious with someone that has a political stance closer to mine. \n\n\nMost people's argument against this is \"but imagine TRUMP as president!!\" Yes, I agree that would not be a good thing, but I also feel that Hillary would not represent me or my beliefs. Although I would consider Hillary Clinton as the lesser of two evils (only by a little), she is still far right of what I would want in my president.\n\n**Edit: Thanks for all of the responses, this is a great community / subreddit. I'm trying my best to get to each comment, but you guys are posting a lot faster than I can read and reply, especially with all of the well thought out and detailed replies. Seriously though, thank you for the great conversations.**\n\nEdit 2: To clarify something, I don't expect any third party candidate to win. Voting third party would just be a vote for someone I believe in, which is part of democracy.\n\nEdit 3: Not too relevant in the overall discussion, but I saw a few comments saying that my views are center right. https://www.politicalcompass.org/yourpoliticalcompass?ec=-5.13&soc=-2.87\n\n**It's 9:40am and I haven't gone to sleep yet, so I'm going to go to bed.

            "selftext": "I have changed my mind on Hillary Clinton. I do believe now that Hillary Clinton is a good choice to be the next president. Let me explain my unorthodox reasoning. \n\nI will try to abstain from using the argument that she can be viewed as a lesser evil compared to Donald Trump, which I previously believed. Although I think this is a valid argument, given that many of Trump political stances (immigration, women, national debt, foreign policy) are extremely undesirable, I think more reasonable arguments could be made to view the candidacy of Hillary Clinton from a different perspective. \n\nPeople tend to favor candidates that come across as familiar. In this respect Trump's bigotry towards minorities connects with many voters. Hillary Clinton has a more difficult time connecting with voters, because she does seem to come across as calculated, untrustworthy, only caring about votes and not really passionate about the issues. \n\nThe thing is, presidents are not in the position to enforce their view on policy on Congress. They ask for a mandate from their constituents, but when it comes to implementing their policy views into law, presidents need to find a majority in Congress to support their view. Look at president Obama, Obamacare is very similar to what Romney already enacted in Massachusetts. If Obama would have been more partisan, there would not be an Obamacare. Therefore, one of the essential characteristics of a president is not to be too partisan. This is already very difficult in the current Congress. \n\nIf you look at the record of Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders, you will see that Bernie Sanders has voted very partisan on the issues ( http://www.thelugarcenter.org/ourwork-Bipartisan-Index.html ). Bernie Sanders is one of the most partisan politician in Congress. Make no mistake, I do like Bernie Sanders, but he is more a grassroot leader than a president. Grassroot leaders push issues to politicians, presidents push deals with politicians through Congress and enforce them. Sorry Bernie, Jill and Gary, although I sympathize with many of your ideas, if any of you would become president, you wouldn\u2019t find the support in Congress to enact them. Hillary Clinton\u2019s record is more bipartisan as she has various allies in the Republican party (http://correctrecord.org/praise-for-hillary-clinton/ ). Therefore, she would be a more effective president. \n\nIs she a good politician? Hillary Clinton ran twice for US senator in New York. When she was re-elected as a US senator after 6 years, she won the election 67,00 %, which indicates that the majority of New Yorkers were happy with her work after 6 years. When she was secretary of state, her approval ratings had an all time high (64%) (Today I read about the Hillary doctrine, quite interesting). This rating declined when she had left the position in the wake of criticism over Benghazi and e-mailgate. I think it is fair to say that she is a good politician (otherwise she would not have been nominated as secretary of state nor would she be a US senator twice). \n\nHillary Clinton is running on a moderate agenda, implementing a lighter version of Bernie Sanders\u2019ideas. Although I am not convinced of all her talking points (not a fan of encryption, moderate change to election financing laws), I do believe this is the right direction. If people want more change, they need to push their representative in Congress. Change comes from bottom up, not top down. Look at gay marriage. Politicians only changed their minds because of the changed political climate (funny clip: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik8JT2S-kBE ). The last thing politicians do is upsetting their constituents (Even Bernie Sanders\u2019record was not always straight on gay marriage). \n\nHillary Clinton, like most politicians, also embodies that philosophy. She is running on what she thinks the majority of people in the United States want. It\u2019s not fancy or extremely inspiring, but her policies are on the right track. Trump does not come even close to that. Hillary will be a president that moves the country to the right direction. Do take into account that the legacy of a president, by appointing a Supreme Court justice, can go far beyond the 4-8 years of the presidency.\n\nAdditionally, top politicians are a special breed and as politics is an ugly art, leader often possess that charismatic aura that makes you forget some of their mistakes. Hillary is a politician functioning at the top of US politics, but she lacks that charismatic aura which makes her more vulnerable to attacks like e-mailgate and Benghazi,  which, if you look at them rationally, they have a  80 mud / 20 scandal rate. Hillary made mistakes in the past, but to say she is very fraudulent or very corrupt is overdone. She already had a political career of approximately 35 years. If nothing really sticks in 35 years, it\u2019s probably not ground breaking. \n\nWith regards to the very recent strategic (wiki)leaks. You cannot blame Hillary on the fact that the DNC wasn\u2019t completely impartial. What was she supposed to do? Please, please don\u2019t favor me? The DNC made mistakes, Hillary played her game and she won. Bernie was not seen by the establishment as a potential good president. Politics is ugly. Sorry Bernie. The claim made today that the DNC was promising federal appointments to donors seems at first hand bogus. They were just looking for potential people to put on the nomination list. I am sure this is gonna be spinned, but so far I don\u2019t see the drama yet.  \n\nDo take into account that the hacker only hacked the DNC and not the RNC. He probably has an agenda (in the cyrillic alphabet) to make people not vote or vote for a fringe candidate to increase the chances for Trump. It\u2019s not an improbable spin. Russia is funding extreme right wing parties in Europe (http://imrussia.org/en/analysis/world/2500-putinism-and-the-european-far-right )\n. \nNext, Clinton Foundation and the Goldman Sachs speeches. The Clinton Foundation gets good reviews by objective sources, Republicans have also worked for this foundation. There could be a conflict of interest, but if he would be serious, she wouldn\u2019t have been appointed as secretary of state or things would have gone nuclear much more earlier. \n\nWith regards to Goldman Sachs, it\u2019s not hard to figure out what is in those speeches. She probably sympathizes in those speeches with the banking industry, wanting to work together with them after the election. This is how every president in the past 50 years has treated the banking industry anyway. Too much banking regulation curbs economic growth, lack of regulation gives a big boom at the end. Don\u2019t forget that governments needs banks.  To blame Bill Clinton for the past banking crisis, does not do justice to history. He had a part, just like many others. It\u2019s easy to lay blame on people at hindsight. By the way, Paul Volcker supported the bipartisan deregulation as well.  \n\nPeople think of Hillary as untrustworthy. This was one of the reasons why I was on the fence with her as well. But consider this, when confronted she thinks like a lawyer. She assesses what is known by her adversaries or and complies her story so it fits the narrative that contains the least damage to her. If new information arises, she occasionally has to change her story. This is really how lawyers defend their clients. It doesn\u2019t always work because new information may arise, but in legal proceedings, it is very effective. It\u2019s a survival skill. If she would have an aura around her like fresh politicians, she would have gotten away with it. Top politicians are a rare breed, they try to fit the narrative of being just like you, but they are not. They all share the same Machiavellian survival skills that most of us don\u2019t (want to) have. Those that serve their constituents well, remain at the top. Hillary remained at the top for decades. Not many other politicians can say that.\n\nI think her survivalskills, decent agenda for the future and bipartisan outlook will make her a good president to handle the future Congress, more than Bernie Sanders, Jill Stein, Donald Trump, and Gary Johnson. Her lack of charismatic aura makes her more prone for criticism, but Hillary Clinton is one of the most resilient politicians on the planet. She has received more punches than Rocky in all of the Rocky movies and she is still standing. You gotta give her credit for that. \n_____\n\n> *Hello, users of CMV!

            "selftext": "So many people seem concerned in Democratic Party unity this election, but I'm not convinced that Clinton ever needed to make any concessions to Sanders's supporters. I supported Sanders's general election campaign, but I think we all have an inflated sense of the importance of Sanders's supporters because they tend to be (1) Redditors, so there's an availability bias, (2) loud, and (3) passionate. But that doesn't necessarily matter in terms of overall votes.\n\nEssentially, the number of Sanders's supporters that Clinton could sway by continuing to make concessions to the left are not enough to justify the effort. Sanders's supporters tended to be young people, who do not turn out in large numbers in a general election. People over 30 are more likely to vote, and they tend to be more moderate, so it made perfect sense for Hillary Clinton to pick Tim Kaine, a more moderate vice president, in the hopes of appealing to centrists who are disillusioned with Donald Trump. Clinton would be better served by spending time making her get-out-the-vote case to the groups of people who already support her and dislike the Donald (i.e., women, minorities, and moderate Democrats), and trying to woo moderate Republicans who have been turned off by Trump, than trying to cater to a group of people who are notoriously fickle on election day.\n\nThis is based on my general sense of the importance of these groups to the overall electoral map, but I have never studied political science. Seeing concrete numbers would be more likely to convince me than mere rhetoric.\n\n_____\n\n> *Hello, users of CMV! This is a footnote from your moderators.

I am not a Hillary Clinton support but rather a Trump hater. So my political beliefs aren't \"blinding me\" as people have been blindly saying to me.\n\n\nOn the Mega thread for the DNC leaked emails and other posts there have been a lot of accusations that people donating were promise positions. I do not see that at all and seems like people are just trying to fabricated evidence to hate Hillary. Here is the link to the article that has been sumbitted to reddit that has caused such a storm.\n\n http://dailycaller.com/2016/07/24/leaked-dnc-documents-show-plans-to-reward-big-donors-with-federal-appointments/ \n\nIn the Article it tries to insinuate that the people on the spreadsheet were promise positions because of their donations to Hillary. There are a lot of problems with that claim. \n\n It tries to hover over the fact that a supervisor asked for a list of people who might be interested in federal positions. No were in any sense does it say there were promise those positions or even asked for those positions. The author's evidence for this is that a women has USPS or U.S postal service next to her name. This woman was literally nominated by Obama but the republican congress block his nomination. So it would make sense to put USPS name to her next because that is obviously what she wants and is qualified for. The notion that she bribed her way into that position is completely fabricated. \n\nThe article then tries to go on and make it seemed that they are just hand picking the largest donors which is just not true and has no evidence.  From what I see from these emails is that someone is asking people within the party to make a list of candidates that has a niche interest in certain boards and would maybe like to be appointed to those boards. They then created a list of their own people, which is done by everyone today, to promote their own. No were does it say that there was promises, that they asked to be given these positions or even that Hillary Clinton was even involved in any of these affairs. I don't think it is even fair to say of this propaganda is real in a sense. It is just fabricated to try to support certain political views.\n\n\n> *Hello, users of CMV!

            "selftext": "It seems at every turn, both the Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump campaigns seem to take the opportunity to shoot themselves in the foot. I think it happens often enough that they're more than mistakes, it's a gross incompetence.\n\nLet's start with the Trump campaign:\n\n- The Trump campaign has let Trump speak off the cuff rather than prepared statements. As Trump isn't an experienced politician, he does not choose his words carefully or think through what he's about to say. This has led to things such as the Curiel \"Mexican\" comments.\n- Trump's long leash extends to his Twitter feed, which he apparently updates himself rather than having a staffer manage it. Trump's quick fingers retweet some questionable things, like the image of Clinton with a Star of David, which originated on a white supremacist board.\n- After the Curiel comments, the campaign let Trump on TV to speak about it again, apparently without notes, where he doubled down on the comments by saying that it would be a problem if Curiel was Muslim, too.\n- The Star of David Tweet was originally explained by the campaign in a way that suggested *they* made it, rather than vetting the source.\n- In response to the Melania Trump speech, they did not vet the speech for similarities to other speeches.\n- In response to the Cruz \"vote your conscience\" booing, Trump ruined the positive campaign coverage by rehashing the National Enquirer story.\n\nNow, the Clinton campaign. While there are fewer, they're larger mistakes:\n\n- In the midst of the email investigation, Bill Clinton met with the head of the ~~FBI~~ Justice Department. This is a very obvious mistake involving the optics of the situation. Considering the opinion from people on both sides of the aisle that Hillary is corrupt, you do *not* make it look anything like you're trying to cut a deal with the prosecutor.\n- The DNC email leak caused Debbie Wasserman Schultz, who attempted to coordinate with the Clinton campaign and dispose of Sanders before the primaries were over, to resign. Within hours, she had a job with the Clinton campaign. This bolsters the image that she is corrupt.\n\n---\nNote: This CMV is about the campaigns, not necessarily about the candidates or who I should vote for.",

            "selftext": "The way I see it, whichever party wins this election, loses.\n\nTrump has taken the GOP stereotype and dialed it up to 11. He represents the vocal minority of the GOP that people often make strawman arguments against. He's made a mockery of the party repeatedly, and every notable republican has at some point over the past year taken a moment to denounce him (even if they have reluctantly decided to back him now). I believe that this will turn off many current republican voters from the party, and especially new young voters who might otherwise swing republican. He's just too much crazy for most people. Perhaps converting to independent, libertarian, or something new.\n\nHillary has messed up. They tried to rig the election ever so subtly, but there are now too many very blatant examples of the people's voice being ignored. The emails we keep getting confirm this. The money she accepts from companies confirm this. The numerous questionable primary results all over the country confirm this. Meanwhile, she is clearly guilty of a federal crime and, if she were anyone else, would absolutely be in prison right now, or at least tied up in an infinite amount of red tape. And on top of all that, the DNC themselves favored Hillary through this whole thing, and everyone was watching. Democrats will question the DNC big time now. Bernie has the power right now to move many Dems to Independent, Green, or something else.\n\nI don't think the GOP shift will happen if Hillary wins, because they will unite against Hillary. Similarly, if Trump wins, I think Bernie will choose to keep the power of the Democrat party behind him rather than splinter it, in an effort to unite against Trump.\n\nCMV.",

He bragged about his dick size in a GOP debate and has suggested he might quit if he's actually elected.\n\nHe consistently thinks women are only valuable for how they look, with at least a dozen high-profile misogynistic comments.\n\nHe's called nuking the middle east a plausible option. He has a suspicious number of ties to Putin, and has a history of business deals with organized crime. He's called mexicans rapists and criminals, been successfully sued multiple times for racist rental practices, and said he wants no blacks only jews counting his money.\n\nHe semi-threatened the pope, mocked disabled people in front of a crowd of thousands, outright threatened violence towards the media and protesters, made sexual comments about his daughters MULTIPLE TIMES, praised Kim Jong Un and Putin and Saddam Hussein, praised the Tianenmen Square massacre.\n\nHe's flirted with white supremacy - retweeting them, reposting their images with anti-semitic symbols, playing coy about David Duke's endorsement. He's a verified lunatic conspiracy theorist - he thinks the Clintons murdered one of their aides, Obama is a sleeper agent and Ted Cruz's dad helped kill JFK.\n\nHe could get caught diddling kids and funding ISIS himself and his supporters would eat it up. Either way, Ladies and Gentlemen, your Republican party nominee.\"\n\nI'll be voting in a swing state (I'm going to school at University of Pittsburgh), which means voting third party feels like throwing my vote. I also don't fucks with the Libertarian party, and Jill Stein has a host of anti-nuclear power rhetoric as well and homeopathic pandering that I'm not down with. \nWhat /u/DetectiveGodvyel missed that I find most troubling is the Supreme Court nominations. Even if I truly find claims of corruption and capitalistic interest on Clinton's part true, I'm most worried about there being 3 Mike Pence's in the SC, reversing LGBT rights and liberal humanitarian efforts back decades. \nThis is merely a sidenote, but the /r/S4P rhetoric seems to be coming from people who can afford to flirt with a trump presidency the most. If you are an upper middle class white male shouting Bernie or bust, the presidency actually effects you the least. \nAnyways, cmv.\n\n\n",

            "selftext": "Hi all. So my view is that we are now WAY to connected to one another and it's causing a lot of problems.\n\nSocial Media in general arrived with MySpace. This happened in about 2005, before there were smartphones and tablets. If social media and the internet in general had remained a thing that only ran on a computer, we many not be having this discussion. It  was the arrival of Facebook and the iPhone that changed how we talk to one another. I feel like since these things occurred and we became more and more anonymous on the Internet, we have become worse to one another and have become polarized.\n\nFor example;\n\nI'm from Ontario, Canada. Right now we have likely the WORST government in existence which is run by the Liberal Party. I made the error of mentioning that I am a Liberal online to a bunch of obscure faces. Without letting me explain, they proceeded to call me an enabler of taxing on tax, reckless spending and supporting a Premier that has had dozens of scandals. Yes, I am a Liberal...normally...but I think that this government is so far gone that I would actually vote them out in favour of the Conservatives if I had too. The point is, once I stated that I am a Liberal, nothing else mattered and I no longer could say anything without getting my head chomped off or called a moron.\n\nThis sort of thing has made me sour at humanity in general. I mentioned once online that Black Lives Matter should look at how they function as a people before pinning it all on the white and Hispanic people. I wasn't being racist with that statement one bit. Still, I was told that I was no better than the average Trump supporter for saying it.\n\nI think the connection online and through our phones has polarized us more than ever. We now go on full on witch hunts before anyone has actually given cold hard facts. People get alienated and shamed online for things they didn't do that they then have to live with because if things like this. Politically we are now a mess world wide. We have violence happening in Europe, Trump/Clinton in the US and elsewhere there is more political bullshit than JFK could fit in an Apollo rocket and send to the moon!\n\nI have been more angry in the past few years over people who can't disconnect while driving. Someone has nearly killed me in a car accident because posting on Facebook was more important than paying attention to the stopped car in front of them. And regardless of deterring laws, people STILL do it.\n\nChange my view on the fact that we need to disconnect in order to re calibrate on ourselves as human beings. We are so bored with life because the online connection is what sustains us now. I'm old enough to remember when side walk chalk was the coolest thing to have on the block...and I'm not even in my 30s!\n\nI once believed in the idea of a Singularity. The idea where we would all come together and understand on another. But as time goes on...I feel like that theory will remain just that. We are all too different from one another to ever fully get along. That notion of \"World Peace is Possible\" that I had while I was a kid is gone. It can't happen.\n\nSo I really honestly challenge you to show me why being connected the closely is a good thing at all. Funny...I complain about the opinions of faceless mob...now I'm asking for them...\n\n_____\n\n> *Hello, users of CMV! This is a footnote from your moderators.

Fix the other stuff and two parties would be fine. Also this system gives the added benefit of usually having an elected official that at least half the people directly voted for.

To change my view, you'll have to convince me that Hillary Clinton has major policy differences from Obama, preferably larger than the difference between Obama and Trump on at least some of the issues.\n\nI think Hillary Clinton will be very similar in policy to Obama. The following are not positions I am endorsing, they are just positions I think the two share. If you hate Obama's policy's you'll probably hate Clinton's. If you love Obama's policy's, you'll probably love Clinton's.\n\n* Health care: Seeks to expand the affordable care act, lots of evidence from 90's and past campaigns that this is a major issue for her - but even in the face of Republican obstructionism she would at least be in a position to preserver it.\n* Taxation and Budget: Supports progressive taxation, proposes spending on all current entitlements but also has elements in her platform like expanded funding for attending public universities, expanded. These sorts of initiatives will depend on a helpful congress - without one I think her budget's will look very similar to Obama's.\n* Climate Change: Does not deny the overwhelming scientific consensus. Supports alternative energy. A little hard to say whether she'd do something like Veto Keystone pipeline, but seems broadly consistent with Obama. \n* Foreign policy: Literally was secretary of state, so talk about continuity! Probably more hawkish than Obama. Shares the general philosophy of US as leader/member of international organizations like NATO, UN, etc. and the responsibilities that those come with.\n* Free trade: Broadly consistent with Obama who has generally supported free trade, not started a trade war with china, only recently cracked down on tax inversion mergers, etc, though pushed in a protectionist direction during the primary. Hard to say exactly how TPP will pan out, and whether Hillary's opposition is very adamant - we'll learn more going forward. \n* Guns: Anti-gun rhetoric - however note that obama did not accomplish anything substantial in terms of gun control legislation. This is really in the hand's of congress, courts, and popular sentiment.\n* Immigration: Plans to support path to citizenship, keep up anti-deportation orders. Very pro-immigration and consistent with Obama.\n* Financial regulation: Obama increased the number of SEC prosecutions and congress passed Dodd-Frank. Hillary Clinton will probably work within this framework, making some modifications to Dodd-Frank, but I strongly doubt she will institute any dramatic financial regulations like breaking up big banks or an High-frequency trading tax.\n* Homeland Security and transparency: Obama has modestly expanded the powers of these organizations after the large expansion under Bush, renewing large parts of the Patriot Act, allowing huge NSA domestic spying programs, and generally not being very transparent about these programs. I don't expect Clinton to change course very much. \n* Pro-Choice\n* Pro Gay marriage",

I do not wish to support Hillary Clinton or the Democratic Party, but I recognize at this point in the election cycle she is the only viable candidate opposing Donald Trump and the Republican Party, whom I will not support under any circumstance.\n\nThe common consensus among die-hard Bernie supporters is that we should vote for a third party in hopes that another party will get enough votes to receive federal funding and put forth a viable presidential candidate for the 2020 election cycle.\n\nThe common criticism of this is that historically votes for third-party candidates have done nothing but spoil elections, citing that President Bush would not have been elected if Nader hadn't taken so many votes from Gore.\n\nIgnoring the fallacy that many of these third-party votes were never going to go to Gore or in this case Hillary, **my argument instead is that this issue is nuanced, and specifically my argument is that the state you live in should play a role in your decision to vote third party.**\n\nFor instance, if you live in a swing state such as Ohio, and if your ideology is progressive and lines up with at least 70% of the Democratic Party's platform, voting for Hillary is likely your most strategic option regardless of whether or not you support her or her party.\n\nLikewise if you are like me and live in Tennessee, a historically red state, voting for Hillary will have roughly the same impact on this election cycle as voting third party. However, voting for a third party candidate - especially during this election cycle - could likely have a significant impact on the 2020 election cycle.\n\nIn one context it could be viewed as irresponsible to vote third-party, and in another context voting for Hillary could be viewed as a wasted opportunity.\n\nOf course this all assumes your ideology is progressive and anti-establishment. If you are truly pro-Hillary or conservative this obviously doesn't apply to you.\n\n_____\n\n> *Hello, users of CMV! This is a footnote from your moderators.

What has gotten almost no attention at all, especially from Democrats and the media, is both Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama voted in favor to build a 700 mile fence across the Mexican border.\n\nIMO, if you're going to criticize Trump and call him a racist for wanting to build a 1,000 mile wall across the Mexican border then both Clinton and Obama should be seen as racists and heavily criticized for succeeded in building a 700 mile fence across the Mexican border.\n\nThat Trump's wall would be 30% longer than Clinton and Obama's is hardly a reason for one to be criticized and called a racist but not the other.  I also object to the idea that there's a significant difference between \"wall\" and \"fence\".  [This is what Clinton and Obama's fence](http://news.nationalgeographic.com/2016/03/160304-us-mexico-border-fence-wall-photos-immigration/) looks like.  I think arguing that there's is a fence and not a wall is nothing more than semantics.  \n\nCMV!\n\nEDIT:  As pointed out by /u/phcullen, it's the Secure Fence Act of 200*6* - not 2008.\n_____\n\n> *Hello, users of CMV!

I don't support Russia or their actions, but at the same time I feel that Clinton and the people who support her are getting what they deserve when they get hacked. \n\nIf they support stealing my data, why should I care when they get their data stolen?\n\n_____\n\n> *Hello, users of CMV!

While that is admirable experience and certainly more than our current President hand and more than her opponent has, but there have been many past Presidential candidate with more experience who were more qualified.  Virtually anyone who served as Vice President and then ran for President was more qualified.\n\nJust for illustrative purposes, let's look at George H.W. Bush (not saying he's the most qualified ever to run, just saying he is an example of someone who was more qualified than Hillary).  At the time he ran for President, his experience consisted of:\n\n* 4 years in the US congress\n\n* 2 years as US Ambassador to the United Nations\n\n* One year as a US Liaison to China.\n\n* One year Director of the CIA\n\n* 8 years Vice President of the United States of America\n\n* He also served in the Navy under various roles and promotions during WWII and served as the Republican National Committee chair for a year.\n\nBoth in terms of total experience, and breadth of service, GHW Bush was far more qualified for the Presidency when he ran for office than Hillary Clinton is now.\n\nAnd just to avoid the (R) vs. (D) potential of my example, Al Gore would have been another person who was more qualified to be President than Hillary is.  He had 8 years US House of Representatives, 8 years Senator and 8 years Vice President.\n\nThat's two example in the past 3 decades.  Surely there are many more going back 240 years.",

            "selftext": "I mean this sincerely; I have no idea why anyone would vote for Donald Trump. I do not mean this to be glib, or be sarcastic. I honestly don't get it. \n\nI want someone to make a case for Donald Trump **without talking about Hillary Clinton**, and tell me why based *only* on his beliefs why Donald Trump should be president. \n\n**He's All Talk**\n\nTo me, he talks like a con man. Everything is great and magnificent and huge. All of his opponents are sad and low energy. He doesn't stand on the strength of his convictions but on the strength of his bragging. His platform is we're going to make America great again. He doesn't say *how* he's going to make it great, or why it isn't great now. It's only that we aren't winning, and he'll make us win again.\n\nBefore taking a needless dig at the president, he said he [\"has the best words.\"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UIE_MRAhEA) Because for some reason he needed to brag in that moment.\n\n**He's Not Equipped to Be President**\n\nHe has shown time and again that he isn't particularly interested in being president, and that he isn't particularly familiar with what's going on. [He didn't have an idea on Brexit](http://thinkprogress.org/politics/2016/06/01/3783685/trump-didnt-know-about-brexit), one of the most consequential world events of recent memory. When he did finally comment on it, he did so [on a trip to Scotland, where he promoted his gold course, and said that a country that voted 62% to Remain was \"going wild\" for Brexit.](http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-scotland-glasgow-west-36606184) When asked about his foreign policy advisers, he \nsaid he listened to himself because he has [\"a very good brain.\"](http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2016/mar/17/donald-trump-i-consult-myself-on-foreign-policy-be/) \n\n**He Lies Consistently, Casually, and Needlessly**\n\nOf all the statements PolitiFact has rated, [18% are 'Pants on Fire' and 37% are 'False.'](http://www.politifact.com/personalities/donald-trump/) 55% of the things he says have *any* resemblance to the truth. Only 4%--[**4%**](http://www.politifact.com/personalities/donald-trump/) of his rated statements are 'True'. As just one of a multitude of examples, [Donald says that he recommended Ohio for the GOP convention.](http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2016/jul/18/donald-trump/trump-says-without-proof-he-recommended-ohio-gop-c/) The only problem is that it's demonstrably false. He never said that. There's no trace he ever said that. It's super easy to point this out.\n\nBut Trump says it anyway, because it picks him up ground. That's Trump's pattern--if he thinkgs something sounds good, he says it, regardless of its truth value.\n\n**He's A Gullible Conspiracy Theorist**\n\nDonald Trump has consistently said that he thinks Ted Cruz's father was involved in the JFK assassination. His source? [The National Enquirer.](http://radaronline.com/celebrity-news/ted-cruz-dad-lee-harvey-oswald-rafael-cruz-photos-experts/) \n\nNot to mention that Trump is the Original Birther. He said that he was [sending investigators to Hawaii to look into Obama's birth-certificate, and that \"they cannot believe what they're finding.\"](http://politicalticker.blogs.cnn.com/2011/04/21/trump-says-hell-reveal-interesting-things-on-obama/) Not to put to fine a point on it, but he made that up. If there ever were any investigators, which I doubt, they didn't find anything. This is another case where Trump says just whatever he thinks will gain him attention.\n\nAnd perhaps most damning, he's gullible. [Donald got caught up promoting a hoax video online.](http://thehill.com/blogs/ballot-box/presidential-races/272824-trump-all-i-know-is-whats-on-the-internet) His defense? \"All I know is what's on the internet.\" He literally just reposts things from the internet as fact without doing *any* due diligence. And his defense is that he didn't look into it?\n\n**tl;dr** In layman's terms, I hear Donald talk, and *there's no there there*. There's just someone shouting for attention, and saying whatever he thinks will get him attention. He's not a leader; he's a child.\n\nWhat do people see, and why do they find it attractive? What am I missing?\n\nedit: I want a case for Trump without reference to Hillary. I said that originally, but I just bolded it up top.",

            "selftext": "Before I get into my argument, I want to say I am a progressive and very much against the TTP.  But I had a thought last night that if congress passed the TTP, they would do MUCH better in the election.\n\nFirst, the reason why they want to wait until the lame-duck session is to avoid electoral lashback.  Senate members (less so in the house), feel they would get a blow back during their election, and some might.   But something to keep in mind is that democrats, especially Obama, will get the majority of the blowback because that's how it always works.  People blame republicans and Bush for the Iraq War, ignoring the hundreds of congress (including the majority of democrats) people that voted for it.   Same with NAFTA, Bill gets all the credit/blame, congress got off mostly scotfree in comparison.\n\nSecond, the Obama is almost guaranteed to sign it.  He has worked on this agree for 6 years and sees it as the capstone to his legacy.  There is 99% certainty that he would sign it.  And he would have to do it within 10 days.  He could veto it and try again in the lame-duck session.  But I don't think he would want to wait, he doesn't tend to play political games like that.\n\nThird, the uneasy 'unity' on the left would be completely disrupted if this happens.  Clinton is very weak on this issue, many of her own supporters don't even believe she is *actually* against the TTP.  And she won't condemn it outright, only saying she wouldn't 'pass it in its current state'.  Whatever that means.\n\nFourth, if Obama signs it, he will have to be taken off of the Clinton team.  Bernie delegates did a 'silent protest' of the TTP during Obama's speech out of the respect for the president.  Instead of the booing and chanting that many felt they should do.  If Obama actually signs it, he would get shouted down at any rallies and went to, and he would become more of a liability threatening unity then an asset to Clinton.\n\nSo in short, if republicans did pass it: they could mostly scapegoat Obama and dems, highlight a point where many people feel Trump is much better then Clinton on, disrupt the uneasy party unity, and remove a key Clinton board piece.\n\n_____\n\n> *Hello, users of CMV!

I looked into all three candidates when O'Malley was in the race before settling on Clinton from the start.\n\nI honestly don't understand this extreme hate for HC. It reeks of manufactured outrage to me. I do admit that her email servers made me seriously pause and question her judgement, that is what opened me up to the idea of Sanders. That didn't last long though. I liked his proposals but it all reeked of bullshit to me. There's no way he could do the things he was promising people. \n\nTo me, and many people, the DNCleaks are a nonissue. I saw a lot of smoke but no fire. I do think its fair that DSW lost her job. Bernie lost fair and square by several million votes. I'm watching the DNC to see my party's leaders speak and the more the Sanders delegates act up, the less and less I respect or empathize with them. \n\n**Edit:** I'm done you guys. I can't possibly reply to  all of you (and honestly, I'm just getting steadily angrier angrier versions of the same message) so I'm bowing out.

I'm also someone who has resisted all notions of Election Fraud. So  I'm not 100% sure yet, still. I need to do more research.\n\nBut let's say, hypothetically, it did happen.\n\nYou still have one of the most obvious choices there's ever been in an election. An overqualified candidate versus a grossly underqualified one. Someone who knows everything about what the job entails versus someone who has no idea what it entails. Someone who has no actual policy other than conspiracy theories and xenophobia versus a candidate with one of the most progressive platforms we've ever seen, who still has a moderate running mate, who is experienced when it comes to working with people who disagree with her, and who, yes, has made her share of mistakes, but is fully capable of the task at hand.\n\nSo if we assume that Election Fraud did occur, and that Hilary won the nomination by cheating, how does it change the fact that she is still clearly the better candidate by far? Third party votes accomplish nothing and I believe that they are morally irresponsible, I really, really doubt you can change my view there. Instead, I want to be convinced that Hilary getting away with election fraud in her own party is as potentially dangerous as Donald Trump.\n\n> *Hello, users of CMV!

            "selftext": "If there is a large portion of the electorate who are looking for change (in this case it would be the Sanders and Trump voters, but it applies to any election) any endorsement of a status quo candidate by those who already benefit from the status quo, unless they have some expertise in the field (for example economists, diplomats, or community leaders) is self-serving and should be ignored.\n\nIf we use this election as an example. Polls seem to suggest a close election between a change candidate(Trump) and a status quo candidate(Hillary). When you include the Sanders electorate though, who voted for another change candidate, it would suggest a majority of the American people want change. Those who endorse the change even when the benefit from the status quo, would suggest that they are not doing so for self-serving reasons. Those who benefit from the status quo telling others that they should vote for the status quo suggests, whether it is true or not, a very self-serving motive. An analogous situation it seems would be nobles endorsing a monarchy.\n\nThe only caveat is not choosing for a candidate, but choosing against one. You can denounce a candidate without endorsing one though, to use the current election as an example, many republican politicians are denouncing Donald Trump without endorsing Hilary Clinton.\n\nBut obviously in almost every election incumbents have had celebrity endorsements and nobody treats them as selfish, I'm trying to understand the argument for why these aren't self-serving and why candidates will often highlight their celebrity endorsements. I would like to see these endorsements in a more positive light. I would like to see the argument that these celebrities are not using their fame to benefit themselves by influencing elections that seem to go against what most of country wants. \n\n(This is not an anti-Hilary or Pro-trump/Sanders cmv, but specifically about those who endorse them)\n\n_____\n\n> *Hello, users of CMV!

            "selftext": "In the current US election for instance, people are attacking both Clinton and Trump for their lack of integrity, morals, values, etc. and act as if their preferred candidate is some amazing and virtuous individual who has near perfect integrity and only the best interests of the country at heart. This is not true and has not been true for the entirety of US history. \n\nA quick look at the statements rated by Politifact as pants-on-fire for Clinton and Trump show that both them have a great proclivity to lie when they feel it beneficial. \nhttp://www.politifact.com/personalities/donald-trump/statements/byruling/pants-fire/\nhttp://www.politifact.com/personalities/hillary-clinton/statements/byruling/pants-fire/\n(Note that while Clinton has much less pants-on-fire ratings from politifact she has a quite a few false rating which clearly also demonstrate her lack of honesty.)\n\nIt is because of this, that I view voting on the basis of integrity to be a very flawed way to participate in shaping the country and can in some cases produce very undesirable results. Such as voting for Trump purely because of a lack of integrity from Clinton, when Trump will surely make many lies in his presidency and also likely break many of his promises he made during his campaign. \n\nPersonally, I vote strictly on the basis of ideology and policy as politicians have shown throughout US history that they are incapable of being honest and free from scandal. Which makes sense considering...politicians are human beings just like the rest of us. They make mistakes, evolve on issues, lie, cheat, but ultimately they all have a vision for this country and that is based on their ideology and the policies they propose.\n\nFor myself, that means voting for Clinton as she is currently the highest match up with me on isidewith.com and after reviewing her website and policies, she is my best choice for shaping the country in my vision. \n\nI encourage all to take the take the quiz on isidewith.com and see who you really match up with best ideologically.\n\n\nAlso, a common argument I hear for voting for integrity instead of policy is when a candidate has a long history of flip flopping on issues they should not be voted for as their proposed policies cannot be trusted. My problem with that is that, at least in the context of US elections, the opposition to that candidate typically has polar opposite views proposed. It is just flat nonsensical to vote for a candidate on the basis on integrity and hope for them to change their position on crucial issue during the presidency because the candidate who did represent your stances had a history of lacking integrity and consistency. Also at least in the US, it is virtually impossible for third party candidates to win on account of our first-past-the-post voting system regardless of how much integrity they 'seem' to have. A third party candidate can only act as a spoiler candidate to the major party candidate who has the ideology closes to them. \n\n_____\n\n> *Hello, users of CMV!

            "selftext": "US General Election. You have two major candidates that have the worst negatives in history. I am an independent voter, and I believe myself to be fairly moderate. I will not vote for Trump, I don't believe he is a good person, and I think he is completely unprepared to be president. I believe in the #NeverTrump movement, not as a Republican, but as an independent who thinks that much of what the country stands for will deteriorate, and our/the global economy will be much worse off, despite his business acumen. So my task is to find a way to not let him WIN in November. This is not my CMV, just the context. Here is my personal basic description of the other two candidates which I would vote for:\n\nHillary Clinton has almost every checkbox on her resume, and I think that whether or not her foreign policy has helped or hurt the world, the experience is a huge factor for me. (I'm a firm believer that it is near impossible to objectively and accurately judge the effects of cabinet members'/presidents' actions before 3-5 presidential terms have passed for historical perspective) Some of her domestic policies are not in line with my views, but I could live with it.\n\nGary Johnson has executive experience, and I agree with many of his policies domestically. Although I don't currently believe he has the experience to deal with the complexities of the foreign policy playing field, I think he is more equipped and willing to listen to foreign policy advisers than Trump, so I think we'd be ok. I also agreed with his policies on the support website that's been going around more than any other candidate (by only 3% over Hillary, 87% to 84%). I think these sites create a choice bias because of the wording of the questions and the answers which you can select. There is no way to fully explain your view, and they only let you pick between the ideas of the candidates.\n\nI will phrase my dilemma as a question because at the moment I am leaning toward Hillary, but I'm still somewhat undecided: **Am I right to vote for Hillary basically as a pragmatic vote to stop Trump from gold plating the white house? Or should I vote for Gary because I align more with his views, and hope my vote doesn't help Trump get elected?**\n\nEDIT: I am from a so-called swing-state in this general election cycle.\n\n_____\n\n> *Hello, users of CMV!

            "selftext": "I don't like Trump. Hillary seems *by far* less insane. But I just read a few things that are now making me think the world might be safer if Trump takes presidency than Clinton. Especially considering a recent press conference with Putin [discussing his concerns](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqD8lIdIMRo) (which are surprisingly very reasonable).\n\nPremise is this:  Hillary's consistent behavior as Secretary of State in the Obama Administration has proved her among the most hawkish, pro-military action voices in the US.\n\nTrump is far more stupid and inexperienced than Hillary. He will have simpler propositions for all our foreign affairs. This may be taken advantage of, but because we are still the most militarized country on earth, he wont be able to make catastrophic mistakes militarily because A) we have the means to deal more damage than any other country if need be, and B) we have great advisers that wouldn't let Trump simply escalate to nukes without due cause, some even threatening to step down if requests become too ridiculous. \n\nYes he is a caveman brute regarding most of his ideas, and he will give a stronger voice to all the sexists, bigots, racists, etc, out there. But that will be only momentarily. And that is also besides the point.\n\nHe doesn't have the intelligence to cunningly and slowly escalate the world to a next world war, whereas Hillary is a different story. Her track record has her consistently making \"calculated\", militaristic decisions that after a decade the majority always thinks to be a mistake.\n\nExamples:\n\n* ~~Clinton signed the Iraq Liberation Act (1998) which helped set the stage for the Bush administration\u2019s disastrous decision to invade Iraq in 2003~~ EDIT: When asked in 2002 about the Iraq Liberation Act, Hillary declared, \u201cI agreed with it in 1998. I agree with it [now].\u201d In her 2003 book, Living History, she quotes her own remarks to the press \u201cas bombs fell on Iraq\u201d during Desert Fox: \u201cI think the vast majority of Americans share my approval and pride in the job that the president\u2019s been doing for our country.\u201d\n* Consistently lobbies to send more troops in to Afghanistan\n* She supported the expansions of NATO despite another superpower saying it will not be tolerated\n* Was a \"cheerleader\" in the Libyan intervention exercise of American (mis)management for regime change leading to chaos\n* She has publicly likened Vladimir Putin to Adolf Hitler, an insult that no one dared to apply to Russian (Soviet) leaders during the 50 years of the Cold War.  That coming from our nation\u2019s senior diplomat virtually closes the door on diplomacy and reason, leaving us with brute force to settle our differences. \n* She has called repeatedly for providing lethal weapons to Ukraine, which, if implemented would put us on a direct collision course with Russia.  \n* She has called for establishing a no-flight zone in Syria well after the Russians introduced their air force assets, including a highly advanced air defense system covering all of Syrian air space/ The result of implementing her recommendations in Syria would be direct armed conflict with the Russian forces in the region if we attempted to enforce an interdiction. (And de jure, we  would be in the wrong, because Russian presence has the express support of the Syrian government, whereas ours does not.)\n* Though not an example itself, the Neocon vultures that took control of US foreign and military policy under Bush-Cheney are now avid supporters of Hillary's candidacy...\n\nSummary:\n\nTrump is the worse human being. He will give a stronger, momentary voice to those filled with hate and fear. Hillary is a first-world warmonger. With her misguided sophistication, she will guide us to another world war. \n\nI think a few years of hate speech (which will not happen without protests)  is  better than the alternative of likely war.\n\n___________________\n\nhttps://consortiumnews.com/2016/07/27/the-fear-of-hillarys-foreign-policy/\n\nhttp://www.zerohedge.com/news/2016-08-04/war-or-peace-essential-question-american-voters-november-8th\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Senate_career_of_Hillary_Rodham_Clinton\n\nhttps://www.washingtonpost.com/news/morning-mix/wp/2016/02/28/former-cia-director-military-may-refuse-to-follow-trumps-orders-if-he-becomes-president/\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqD8lIdIMRo\n\nI hope this isn't too long.

            "selftext": "Donald Trump [said this at a rally in NC today](http://www.latimes.com/nation/politics/trailguide/la-na-trailguide-updates-donald-trump-says-second-amendment-1470771050-htmlstory.html):\n\n>\u201cHillary wants to abolish, essentially abolish the 2nd Amendment. By the way, and if she gets to pick if she gets to pick her judges, nothing you can do folks. Although the 2nd Amendment people, maybe there is. I don\u2019t know.\u201d\n\nMany people interpreted this as encouraging his supporters to assassinate either Clinton or her judicial appointments. \n\nThe Trump campaign has since come out and claimed that Trump was talking about Second Amendment advocates unifying to vote against Hillary. For example, Mike Pence said:\n\n>\"Of course not. Donald Trump is urging people around this country to act consistent with their convictions in the course of this election. And people who cherish the 2nd Amendment have a very clear choice in this election.\"\n\n**Now, to be clear, we have no way of knowing what Trump *meant*, so all we can debate is the meaning of the actual words he said.**\n\nI hold that if we go by what he SAID, the only possible interpretation is one of advocating violence. The key is in this sentence:\n\n>**if she gets to pick her judges**, nothing you can do folks. Although the 2nd Amendment people, maybe there is. \n\nAs the \"if...\" clause makes clear, in this part of the speech he's making a hypothetical about what will happen if Hillary is elected president. The Trump campaign explanation for his statement thus makes no sense...IF Hillary gets to pick her judges, there is nothing the Second Amendment folks could do about that by voting, because if Hillary is picking judges then the election is *already over*. \n\nTo put it another way: Trump's assertion is that Second Amendment folks might be able to do something \"if Hillary is picking judges.\" There's no way he could be referring to voting, because if Hillary is picking judges, the voting has already happened. Moreover, Trump suggests that only second amendment people (gun owners) would have a chance of doing something about her judicial choices. From his own statement, we know that he is:\n\n1. Not talking about voting, because in his hypothetical the voting has already happened, and...\n2. He is specifically singling out gun owners as being the ones able to affect a change.\n\nHow can this statement possibly be interpreted as anything other than a suggestion that second amendment advocates might shoot Clinton or her appointees? \n\nI'm not sure whether I can be convinced or not, but I'm open to changing my view if you can provide a convincing argument that Trump's words could be reasonably interpreted to mean something else. \n_____\n\n> *Hello, users of CMV!

I posted a lot of views, and while not all have been changed, y'all did correct quite a few. Thanks, again!\n\nI'm a soldier, and I want to be able to proudly serve under my next president. The only problem is I absolutely hate Hillary Clinton. Like, entirely despise her. Below I will post what I believe, and they are beliefs I don't want to believe in. Please change my views. In my oath of service I swore to obey the Constitution above the president. I don't want to spend the next 4-8 years believing I'm not following my oath.\n\nI see her as a puppet to huge donors, such as massive corporations, and foreign nations like Saudi Arabia. She has no care for the actual American people. She gets away with ger crimes due to her power alone. Anyone else who has done even a fraction of what she's done would be locked away for life or executed.\n\nThe majority of the media is basically in her pocket and ignores everything she does wrong, while making everything any other candidate does headline news. It highlights how corrupt our media is.\n\nThere is evidence of voter fraud against Bernie Sanders and I worry she may attempt it again against Trump and Johnson. It undermines democracy itself, and frankly how little anyone seems to care about this pisses me off. She was losing in the polls until polling companies changed their algorithms, making it look like she has support when she doesn't. She's doing this to make her voter fraud less obvious.\n\nHer proposed gun legislation is absolutely unconstitutional, and is a direct threat to our social contract as a nation and our ability to defend ourselves against other people, and most importantly, our government. I feel like if it were up to her, I would not be able to defend myself. Props to anyone who can change this view in particular. I'm a historian by education, and I know that it is against everything the founding fathers believed when they designed our nation. It's something I'm incredibly passionate about. All others aside, this alone is enough to make sure she never gets my vote.\n\nWhile social issues are important, she devotes far too much time talking about social problems, and spends too little time proposing economic reform or foreign policy reform. And what foreign policy she does advocate, will likely be the same kind of interventionist meddling in other nations, arms distribution bullshit.\n\nSyrian refugees are not our problem, and even if 99% of them are great people, there is still the chance of bringing in terrorists, which is unacceptable. All incoming people should be subject to the legal process of immigration. No exceptions.\n\nTerrorism is a threat to our nation, and she downplays it as if it is not. Even if it happens infrequently, the fact that it happens at all is reason enough to take any necessary action.\n\nDNC opponents are dropping like flies. They seem to be dying left and right. I don't see how it can be a coincidence.\n\nTrump is far from perfect, but I think his policies are safer for national security, and with him, even if he says dumb things every now and then, I have no doubts about his unwavering patriotism, and as far as crime goes, he is far less guilty. This part isn't really in contention. I don't want this to turn into an anti-Trump-fest. I want to actually change my views of Hillary herself. It seems the only arguments I ever actually hear for Hillary are really just anti-Trump shit and have nothing to do with her.",

Notably, Colin Powell used AOL, exposing his official emails to whoever happened to be working in AOL\u2019s IT department.

(Clinton sent only one email to a foreign dignitary through her personal account\n\n**(2)** The number of emails with \u201cmarkings indicating\u201d classified information is apparently three. None of these emails had proper classification markings in the header, making them easy to miss. And at least one (maybe two) of the emails were actually unclassified, and thus incorrectly marked.\n[Link](http://www.factcheck.org/2016/07/revisiting-clinton-and-classified-information/)\n\n**(3)** Some emails were retroactively determined to have classified information, even though they had no markings. But that classification process is subjective and disputable, meaning reasonable people could have believed those discussions were not classified at the time.\n[Link](http://www.cnn.com/2016/01/22/politics/hillary-clinton-email-server-classified/)\n> The State Department disputed the claim at the time, suggesting there was a misunderstanding about the information in the emails, which was never considered classified at the State Department.\n\n**(4)** Some of the emails mention secure channels, which were separate from the private email server. This strongly suggests that Clinton and her aides understood that no classified information was supposed to go to her private address and anything that wound up there was in error. One of the supposed smoking guns related to this (Clinton appearing to tell an aide to send classified info over a non-secure channel), has in fact been disproven.\n[Link](http://mediamatters.org/research/2016/01/10/state-department-disproves-hugh-hewitts-claim-t/207884)\n\nPutting all of this information together with Oscam\u2019s Razor, it seems very believable to me that Clinton figured it would be convenient to receive her non-classified emails at her private email address (which she had every right to have), and had a strict policy in place that no classified information was to be discussed at that address. This was a *vastly* superior setup to that of her predecessors, one of whom used an AOL account for official business. The fact that there were very occasional slips does not suggest she lied to the public. It\u2019s more of an exception that proves the rule. And it is completely believable that she would not remember or did not fully read those particular (two or three out of 60,000) emails that contained markings in their body, which supposedly confirm she lied. So it seems highly plausible that she was being truthful at the time she made her various statements that people are now calling lies. \n\nFinally, regarding the possibility that this was an attempt to shield herself from FOIA requests: that makes no sense to me. Most work-related emails would have other .gov email addresses in the chain so their contents would be stored in State Department servers. She could still potentially have had unethical conversations on her private email address with non-.gov emailers. But how would that possibility have been any less likely if she received all official work emails on a department server?  And to those who say we can\u2019t know what other information was in the deleted emails, I would offer that this still does not suggest she lied or did anything unethical. Pretty much everyone in public life has a private email account, which we can never know the contents of.\n\nEdit: Am I not seeing the real truth or just selectively choosing facts and ignoring clear evidence that Clinton lied? I want to understand if there is real meat to the scandal that has been at the top of the news for months. Please change my view.\n_____\n\n> *Hello, users of CMV!

Believing that the unborn do not have personhood is a valid reason to believe abortion should be legal (although, it's a ridiculous belief, IMO, that the unborn are not people). This CMV is a question to those who believe that it doesn't matter whether or not the unborn is a person, because the pregnant woman has a right to bodily autonomy, and it's her choice no matter the status of the child. Many politicians take this stance, such as Hillary Clinton\n\n\"Bodily Autonomy\" is not a valid argument for abortion being legal. Abortion advocates often claim \"the government\" can't tell me what to do with my body. However, this is not a valid argument because the woman brought the unborn child into the womb by choice and her killing the child by choice is not only affecting her body, but also the child's body. Your rights end when another's begin. We use this justification to tell people what to do with their body all the time. An example is drunk driving. Why should the government be able to tell you what to do with your body? Why shouldn't you be free to get drunk and get in a car? The reason why you cannot is because drunk driving is extremely dangerous to others and your right to bodily autonomy is superceded by their right to live. Also what about the unborn's right to bodily autonomy? Their right to bodily autonomy is destroyed by an abortion along with all their other rights.\n\n_____\n\n> *Hello, users of CMV!

            "selftext": "The *CSI Effect* refers to the effects of procedural crime dramas on real-world jurors. People expect to see hard forensic evidence in criminal trials where it simply isn't used as frequently as on television. These jurors are less likely to accept the sorts of circumstantial evidence that are commonly used in criminal court. \n\nI believe that House of Cards has a similar effect on American politics. The main character, Frank Underwood, is essentially an evil genius. He cleverly manipulates other politicians, the media, business leaders, and the general public to act in ways that increase his political power and give him ever more leverage in any given situation. The success of the show has also coincided with rising political partisanship, and (I believe) a perception on each side of the aisle that opposing leaders are similarly corrupt evil geniuses. Obama and Hillary Clinton are often accused of subtle manipulations, scandals, and cover-ups on par with the illegal actions taken by Underwood and his allies in the series. Additionally, the House of Cards government is often able to accomplish bold tasks swiftly and efficiently, such as implementing a jobs program or ending an oil crisis. [Obama was quoted](http://swampland.time.com/2013/12/17/obama-wishes-washington-was-really-like-house-of-cards/) as wishing that the real government ran with such efficiency as it seems to under President Underwood. Voters today see even arguably simple processes like passing a budget or confirming judicial nominees stalled interminably, where the HoC government deals with much more complicated matters with relative ease. This works to create an unrealistic expectation for government to work efficiently. \n\nMy view is that politicians are a lot like the rest of us: some are smart, some not so much, but no one is skillfully manipulating their way to the top, playing everyone else like pawns. The pawns have their own schemes and are playing them right back, to the frustration of everyone involved in government. \n\n\n\n> *Hello, users of CMV! This is a footnote from your moderators.

            "selftext": "In my view, it is exceedingly difficult to support Donald Trump in an intelligent and thought-out manner. I don't find it to be a mere coincidence that most policy wonks and technocrats, ranging from left-of-center to right-of-center in political orientation, are terrified of a Trump presidency. Top analysts and experts at The Economist, Wonkblog, Vox, Wall Street Journal, FiveThirtyEight, The Upshot, Christian Science Monitor, let alone countless think tanks across the political spectrum (Brookings, Cato, Heritage, etc.), have harshly condemned Trump's candidacy for being largely devoid of details or even broad policy proposals, let alone proposals based on the weight of evidence. \n\nTrump's core constituency, based on polling and other demographic surveys, are middle age, non-university educated, working class, white and male, while educated voters across all demographics are rejecting Trump. Educated voters are supporting Hillary Clinton if they're more left-leaning, or Gary Johnson if they're more right-leaning. The very few \"intelligent\" people to have endorsed Trump (Donald Rumsfeld, Peter Thiel, Carl Icahn, etc.) have done so mainly because they don't want a Democrat in the White House and want a conservative SCOTUS. \n\nIf someone is genuinely supporting Trump, they are essentially supporting a \"bullshit artist,\" having lost much of his connection with reality. Liars are acutely aware of what they perceive to be the truth, but Trump has shown complete recklessness and disregard for the fact. Here are some things he's said:\n\n- disputed obama's birth certificate and U.S. citizenship, was at the heart of the 2011 birther movement, and publicly doubted Obama was born in the U.S.\n- said by Obama's own admission, he was born in Kenya \n- publicly suggested Obama didn't attend Columbia University \n- suggested that Obama is a Muslim back in 2011\n- said that he sent investigators to Hawaii to examine Obama's birth, but investigators weren't sent\n- called for implementing 45% tariff on Chinese goods and leaving the WTO, which professional economists almost unanimously think is insane \n- called anthropogenic climate change a hoax created by the Chinese to make American manufacturing non-competitive\n- viewed asbestos as a safe and effective fire retardent \n- linked vaccines to an autism epidemic, saying he's actually seen vaccines directly causing autism\n- said he saw thousands of american muslims celebrating 9/11 in New Jersey, despite this being thoroughly debunked \n- called for banning non-citizen Muslims from the U.S.\n- supported creating a database for Muslims in America, and called profiling Muslims \"common sense\"\n- defended the internment of Japanese-Americans in World War II\n- said he'll swiftly deport 11 undocumented immigrants, praising the 1950's era Operation Wetback as a model\n- mocked a disabled reporter on live television \n- said ISIS provides phones to refugees seeking to enter the U.S., without any evidence\n- said that the \"real\" unemployment rate is 42%, despite being thoroughly debunked, and receiving pants on fire and 4 Pinocchio ratings by fact checkers \n- said that the unemployment rate is 23%, despite being thoroughly debunked, and receiving pants on fire and 4 Pinocchio ratings by fact checkers \n- ignorantly claimed China was part of the TPP\n- alleged that Ted Cruz\u2019s father, Rafael, collaborated with Lee Harvey Oswald, the assassin of President John F. Kennedy to assassinate JFK, and cited the Lee Harvey Oswald claim from an article in the National Enquirer \n- said he has proof that mexico is sending criminals and rapists to the U.S., even though this has been thoroughly debunked\n- didn't know the difference between the Quds, members of the Iranian Revolutionary Guards, and the Iraqi Kurds\n- thought women are only valuable for how they look, with at least a dozen high-profile misogynistic comments\n- defended his penis size on a presidential debate stage \n- asserted that he'd have the military kill the innocent family members of terrorists, and bring back waterboarding and \"much worse\" (despite evidence showing \"enhanced interrogation\" failed to produce actionable intelligence)\n- called the Geneva Conventions a problem\n- stated that he's fine with prosecuting U.S. citizens in Guantanamo Bay  \n- vowed to seize Syria's oil fields and refineries, which help keep ISIS afloat, and then sell the oil to pay for a U.S. military campaign. However, if the U.S. actually stole the oil, it would only net about $500 million, at most. A year long excursion in Syria of 20,000-30,000 U.S. troops (which trump has called for) would realistically cost around $25 billion\n- incorrectly thought Tim Kaine was the governor of New Jersey, despite Chris Christie being one of Trump's most vocal backers \n- thought he could address America's fiscal issues by reneging on U.S. sovereign debt, an idea that was universally panned by economists since it would trigger a worldwide recession much worse than 2008\n- refused to initially disavow KKK endorsements, David Duke, and other white nationalists/supremacists backing him, saying he didn't \"know anything\" about Duke and white supremacists \n- reposted and retweeted anti-Semitic symbols \n- retweeted a bogus crime graphic comparing black-on-black murders to police violence\n- retweeted a nazi-sympathizing white supremacist \n- encouraged violence at his rallies multiple times, lamented about how \"their used to be consequences\" for protesters, justified violence by protesters saying that the \"country has to toughen up,\" and \u201cmaybe he should have been roughed up because it was absolutely disgusting what he was doing,\" and \u201cI don\u2019t know if I\u2019ll do the fighting myself, or if other people will\"\n- said \u201cI\u2019d like to punch him in the face,\" after Trump supporter sucker-punched a protester at a rally (and later threatened to kill him if he showed up again), with Trump saying, \"He was swinging, he was hitting people, and the audience hit back. That\u2019s what we need a little bit more of\"\n- said about protesters, \"if you see somebody getting ready to throw a tomato, knock the crap out of them, would you? Seriously, OK? Just knock the hell \u2014 I promise you, I will pay for the legal fees. I promise. I promise\" \n- supported unequivocally his former campaign manager, Corey Lewandowski, when he assaulted Brietbart News reporter Michelle Fields\n- said a judge in the Trump University case was biased against Trump because of the judge's Mexican heritage \n- said Obama and Hillary founded ISIS, then said he was being \"sarcastic,\" and then his campaign said he was \"serious\"\n- accused Obama of being an ISIS sympathizer \n- suggested that Hillary Clinton is secretly ill, and lacks the \"mental and physical stamina\" to take on ISIS, perpetuating an alt-right conspirarcy theory that Clinton secretly suffers from a serious, chronic ailment \n- said that Putin wasn't in Crimea despite Russia invading Eastern Ukraine and maintaining a presence a few years earlier\n- lied about meeting Putin in Russia\n- called on Russian hackers to find Hillary Clinton's missing Secretary of State emails\n- said John McCain isn't a war hero \"because he was captured\"\n- accepted a Purple Heart from a veteran despite having been a draft-dodger\n- didn't know what the nuclear triad was\n- said women who get abortions should be punished\n- said Ghazala Khan didn't speak with her husband Khizr at the DNC because she \"wasn't allowed to\" (because of her Muslim faith), without any evidence\n- suggested that after the election, if Hillary Clinton wins, the \"second amendment\" people could take her out to prevent her from appointing pro-gun control SCOTUS judges (while he later \"clarified\" he was talking about having the gun lobby vote against Clinton this election cycle, many people, including in the audience, thought he implied violence against Clinton)\n- suggested that the Clintons could have murdered Vince Foster\n- said Clinton was responsible for the death of a nuclear scientist in Iran\n- speculated that Antonin Scalia was murdered \n- blamed terrorism for EgyptAir crash without any evidence at all\n- threatened to open up libel laws because of newspaper criticism against his campaign \n- asserted that the general election is inherently \"rigged,\" without any evidence \n- supported the spreading of nuclear weapons to other countries\n- praised the 1989 Tienanmen Square massacre in China\n- praised authoritarian dictators like Kim Jong-un, Putin, and Saddam Hussein \n- referred to 9/11 as \"7/11\"\n- semi-threatened the pope \n- threatened to withdraw from NATO\n\nIf someone genuinely supports Trump, in that they feel his stated policy proposals will genuinely improve America, and believe his talking points, and they aren't supporting him as a lesser-of-two-evils, I don't view them as smart or well-informed on politics. Trump is a serial conspiracy theorist. Trump has consistently demonstrated that he's plainly ignorant about basic public policy issues and basic political facts. He's a master at pushing emotional buttons, and his supporters aren't bright enough, educated enough, and informed enough to know he's a demagogue. \n\n\n\n",

            "selftext": "Hillary Clinton is actually an extremely strong candidate and would be doing just fine in a contest with any of the Republicans who ran this year, although her lead might be smaller. \n\nI will talk about her positives, then the GOP's negatives.\n\n**Firstly**, she has near universal name recognition and is attached to a popular former President. She was a politically active first lady, a reasonably well liked Senator, a very strong contender for the 2008 primary, and a Secretary of State. She has been in the national eye for 24 years and has been attached to two very popular Democratic presidents.\n\n**Secondly**, she has been in the national eye for so long that she can handle scrutiny exceptionally well. I'd say the biggest example of this is her keeping her cool during 11 hours of hearings about Benghazi, but she's been doing it since at least 1992.\n\n**Thirdly**, she, as part of the biggest power-couple in the world, also has an insane network of friends and talent in every level of government and among the best staffers as well. The Democratic Party leadership, specifically Obama, Reid, Pelosi, etc. dissuaded any other serious challengers. She also inherited the phenomenal campaign staff and infrastructure that Obama built during his runs. \n\n**Finally**, any Democrat has an baked in advantage simply due to the growing share of minorities, women, and young people in the electorate. Republicans have not made significant inroads with any of these demographics.\n\nOnto the Republicans:\n\nI will only cover the ones who received at least 1 delegate for simplicity's sake. I want to be clear that I believe every one of these candidates would be doing better than Trump in a general election, but I think they would still be losing vs. Hillary. \n\n* **Ted Cruz** is extremely far right and is too conservative for the general electorate. His greatest accomplishment is shutting down the government. He also has a very punchable face and gives off a sinister vibe, although I don't know the effect of this so I can concede this point. \n\n* **Marco Rubio** is the textbook definition of an empty suit, and he completely flopped under pressure from Christie during the debates (leading to the Rubio-bot meme). He was an absentee Senator and his biggest advantage - his support from Hispanics - is largely nixed because he backed out on his \"Gang of Eight\" immigration reform policy. \n\n* **Kasich** is a bit of a wildcard because he received such low support that he was never given any sort of scrutiny. However, I see no  reason to believe that he would do better with minorities, women, or young people than Mitt Romney did, which are the key demographics they need to win over in order to take 270 EV. \n\n* **Jeb Bush** is equally as uncharismatic as Hillary, but has his name attached to his brother's presidency and would be weighed down by that. Not to mention his policy proposals are as \"Generic Establishment Republican\" as they come, which would be used to attack him over and over. \n\n* **Rand Paul** is a libertarian nut and some of his positions (like his opposition to the Civil Rights Act on \"purely constitutional grounds\") would be battered over his head over and over.\n\nAnyway, CMV \n\n_____\n\n> *Hello, users of CMV!

            "selftext": "For some background, I do not think Hilary has accomplished that much in her positions. I do not think she is a great candidate for president but I also don't think she has any malicious intent that will harm the US for the long term. \n\n I agree that she should not have had an unsecure email server, and the deaths in Benghazi could have been prevented. That doesn't mean that they were malicious decisions by Hilary alone instead of just bad decisions by a larger group of people. The Benghazi event was reviewed by multiple bi-partisan committees and they concluded that there was an oversight but Hilary herself was not at fault. In the case of the emails scandal, a similar practice was used by Colin Powell without incident so it isn't unreasonable that Hilary would assume she could continue it. \n\nDuring her primaries against Sander and Obama I totally accepted the idea that she was corrupt and lied about her past frequently because it is the generally accepted view by most people I know. However, (besides benghazi and the email scandal) the accusations of murdering informants, taking bribes, and other corrupt actions all boil down to \"there is no evidence that she did this and that's what's so scary.\"\n\nHilary Clinton has been in the public eye for over twenty years. Politicians on both sides get smeared by their opposing party constantly. Thus, I feel that the likelihood of the public opinion on her being warped by 20 years of this is greater than the likelihood that she is the center of a massive conspiracy.\n\nEdit: /u/overthrow23 pointed out the whitewater scandal and the pardons granted afterwards. This hasn't totally changed my view but it has tweaked it and I plan on reading more about it.\n\n_____\n\n> *Hello, users of CMV! This is a footnote from your moderators.

            "selftext": "First of all, I don't actually approve of any of the candidates. Like most of the reddit hivemind I don't support Donald Trump or Hillary Clinton and none of the alternative party candidates appeal to me. I think Jill Stein is a loon and I don't approve of Gary Johnson's neoliberal economic policies so I don't want to throw my support that way.\n\nI don't think it really matters anyway. My state will go blue no matter my vote. Due to first-past-the-post and the electoral college, I believe the only reasonable thing for a single voter to do is to vote \"strategically\". The general strategy that is usually proposed is to vote with my heart if I'm not in a swing state/county, otherwise I must vote against the person I least want to win. Voting for anything other than one of the two big party candidates is really just a protest vote. I did this last time in 2012 but TBH, the whole thing feels like a waste of time and I believe my participation only serves to provide tacit approval of this farce.\n\nFinally, I think the entire process of voting for president is irrational to begin with. Even if somehow one of these alternate party candidates were to miraculously win, it would only serve to ensure more insanity and dysfunction in the Capitol. At that point, Jill Stein or Gary Johnson would be the _only_ member of their party in any federally elected position and they would most likely be fighting a losing battle against Republicans and Democrats in Congress. I think the process of majority party/coalition in Parliament selecting the head of state as they do in most other countries is just a more sensical system. The whole system seems broken to me.\n\nSo why bother? Honestly as I've gotten older my view of American politics has grown more and more cynical over the years and I think this may be my first step towards not voting anymore at all. I don't really believe my country is a functioning democracy anymore, but I hate being this cynical. I'm hoping someone can change my view on this and convince me to vote, or at least even give a shit anymore.\n\nedit: hey folks, I guess I've been convinced I should still vote on the other positions down the ballot, but my views on the presidential election specifically have not changed.\n\n_____\n\n> *Hello, users of CMV!

            "selftext": "Disclaimer: before attacking me for being partisan, please know that I am only using Correct the Record as an example because they are a well known example of a PAC dedicated to social media campaigning. The issues I raise are applicable across the board for every campaign.\nIn this campaign season it has been made clear that Correct the Record is a PAC dedicated to the support of Hillary Clinton online. The about section on their website states: \"Correct The Record is a strategic research and rapid response team designed to defend Hillary Clinton from baseless attacks.\"         \n         \nThe PAC has been seen as responsible for a large number of pro-Clinton posts and comments made on various social media websites, Reddit included. Whether this is true or not is clouded by the fact that they are not necessarily making it clear that their posts are being paid for by the CTR PAC. If they were required to put disclaimers on their messages and comments, it would lead to a greater level of transparency in the election process. The messages posted online are tantamount to anonymous propaganda (in my opinion).         \n            \nNow, to the point about disclaimers. The FEC currently requires that political committed place a disclaimer with their message that makes it clear that their message is being paid for. At the end of videos made by CTR, they do place their logo; however, there isn't even a clear disclaimer as to who they are and that they are a PAC. If they are making comments and posts online, I have yet to see a disclaimer at the end of a Reddit post, twitter page, Facebook post, etc.\nNow, on to the FEC regulations. The FEC website makes it clear that:         \n            \n\"Political committees must include a disclaimer on (1) all \"public communications\" (defined below), (2) bulk electronic email (defined as electronic mail with more than 500 substantially similar communications) and (3) web sites available to the general public, regardless of whether the communication expressly advocates the election or defeat of a clearly identified candidate, or solicits funds in connection with a federal election (i.e., contributions for a federal candidate or federal political committee).\" (http://www.fec.gov/pages/brochures/notices.shtml[1] )        \n          \nNow, please direct your attention to number 3. Social media websites, e.g. Reddit, are most certainly websites available to the general public. However, the definition provided for \"public communications\" is given as: \"General public political advertising does not include Internet ads, except for communications placed for a fee on another person\u2019s web site.\" Now, the question remains whether or not the comments should be considered Internet ads which, as they are not paying Reddit for the appearance of the comments, may be excluded from needing a desclaimer, or if they should be covered by the third section that states that a disclaimer must be placed on websites available to the general public.             \n           \nBecause comments and posts appear on websites available to the general public and are made by persons paid for by a PAC, I believe they should require a disclaimer.\n\nEdit: formatting\n\n_____\n\n> *Hello, users of CMV!

            "selftext": "I used to be a fan of IRV, because it seemed to make sense, and be similar to normal voting, just with backups. As I've looked into it further though it seems too opaque, and too prone to weirdness, to be a substantial improvement. This article covers the basic problems well http://minguo.info/election_methods/irv\n\nInstead I've gravitated towards Range Voting, which just means every candidate that reaches some required threshold can run, and every voter can give each candidate a score (say 0-9 or 99) and at the end, whichever candidate with the most points/highest average(these are the same as I understand it) wins. \n\nIt seems though that IRV is more well known/popular, so I'm open to the idea that Range has some big flaw I've missed, or IRV is less problematic/more advantageous than I think. \n\n\nI'm going to try to unpack some of the discussion, the points made, and my qualms with them here.\n\nThe basic points touched on are why I don't think there would be only 2 viable candidates, and why people could and would give multiple candidates top scores, especially if they felt their true favorite had low odds of winning, the position that Range Voting rewards and encourages Strategic Voting less than most methods, and that even its Stategic Voting expresses more, and more honest opinions of the voter than FPTP or IRV, the assertion that normal voting behavior under Range Voting will naturally prevent unknown lunatics from winning, and my belief that the advantages of Range over Approval voting outweigh the potential downsides. Finally I suggest a system of proxy Range Voting and it's effects on campaign rhetoric, strategy, and positioning. \n\nHere we go.\n\n**The assumption that 2 major candidate would emerge, or that people would give low rankings/0s to candidates they like, but perceive as unlikely to win (these are related, because the later reinforces, and leads to the former)**\n\nThis doesn't make sense. \n\nIf you believe your favorite choice to be unlikely to win, you can still happily give them a top score, and hedge by giving your favorite \"viable\" candidate a top score as well, sharing the top score would only mean you've failed to make your actual favorite more likely to win if it came down to that and your \"viable backup\", you've done nothing to help your least favorite candidate(s) or hurt your favorite or your back-up in relation to the rest of the candidats. If you were wrong about your favorite candidates chances, you could be pleasantly surprised to have helped elect them. If you were correct and the masses disapprove of them heartily, then your top score helps keep them from being quite so soundly defeated, while your top score for a viable candidate keeps your vote useful in determining the eventual winner (beating out those you don't want, and therefore rated low or 0). Because of this dynamic, several strong candidates from each position could emerge, only competing for attention/funding, not votes, what's more, candidates could be surprisingly strong not by representing 1 faction, but by carefully blending the positions of many factions, while also establishing a personal brand of compromise, capability, and \"someone who uses the right tools, no matter which party's name is on them\" and win by not being hated by anyone, and having some folks in the center to really like them, while candidates from both sides slug it out and get dragged down by the oppositions low scores. Because so many potential position combinations could be viable, two obvious frontrunners would be unlikely (or at least, no more likely than 1, or 3, or 5). \n\n\n**Range Voting punishes honest voting**\nFirst, obviously so does FPTP, and almost as much IRV. The reason for this is simple. If 4 candidates are running, Called Radical Left, Center Left, Center Right, and Radical Right (RL, CL, CR, RR)\n\nAll my fancy formatting disappeared when published leaving a mess, so here's an image showing the results\nhttps://postimg.org/image/fyn1x9w8v/\nIn this case, just 1 voter who was between RL and CL deciding to put CL first instead of RL would have resulted in the election of CL instead of CR. This means that anytime a non-major party candidate gains too much in the polls they have at least as good a chance of causing their opposed major party to win as to win themselves, much like the typical FPTP spoiler problem. Note that Radical Left lost by 4 points, even though the Left had a voter advantage of 3 points, and even the centrists overwhelmingly broke Left when choosing CL vs CR, so this represents a high point for the Left, yet the Center Right runs away with it because of non-strategic voting. This result then would encourage strategic voting enough to keep 3rd parties out, just like FPTP.\n\nThat's the gist of what my link got at. \n\nTo respond directly to the Range Voting punishes honest voting though, is more complex. \nSince different voter strategies can result in quite different candidate strengths (a broadly popular centrist liberal might seem strong, but a lot of far left folks figure this is the election to win and their main obstacle is the popular centrist, they could bullet vote their candidate (top score to them, 0 to everyone else) and potentially win sure, but they might end up giving the election to a moderate conservative because that side went for approval voting (every acceptable candidate gets a top score, the rest get 0) and boosts the score of a reasonably well liked, but lacking in vocal support candidate since the lefties got overconfident and tanked their candidate with broad appeal, they could even lose out to pure honest voters if enough of the moderate liberals supporters consider the leftists candidate to be as worrisome as the capable moderate conservative, and a lot of conservatives at least like that candidate enough. It depends on how many leftists there are, just how unified they can make their bullet vote, and how surprisingly well/broadly liked the moderate conservative is, all of which could be very hard to poll with much accuracy. \n\nEssentially my argument against Range Voting doing much to encourage strategic voting is that in the real world, doing so would be just so hard and fraught with risk that people wouldn't bother, this is unlike IRV or FPTP where both the method (put most viable candidate you can stomach on the top of your ballot) and the effect (avoid accidentally helping your least favorite candidate get elected) is clear. No one can wonder if by strategically choosing to put Clinton over Stein on a IRV ballot they've actually helped a less desirable candidate get elected.\n\nPut differently, different strategic votes can accomplish different things, but because the landscape of the election is much harder to predict which one is right for any particular election until after the fact, and honest voting tends to split the difference, as in, if it really IS a big year for leftists, and you can convince enough voters to place the far left candidate on top, even though they aren't MUCH higher than the moderate leftist, they could win after all, especially if the other-side goes for approval voting, thereby eliminating the moderate lefty's advantage from the right, and if the year isn't quite as good as you thought, you've just elected the moderate lefty instead of the moderate righty. So advantage to the honest lefty voters over the strategic righties in that case.\n\n**Approval Voting is better because people can't accidentally weaken their vote**\n\nThis also addresses the argument that Approval Voting is better because it doesn't allow people to \"weaken\" their vote. My main response to that is to say that only by restricting the maximum range of scores given to viable candidates can you \"dilute\" your vote, and while this might happen some, there's no reason to think it would only happen to one side, and thus distort the election much (if that were the case, that side would likely quickly correct that mistake for the next go-round) and indeed Approval Voting is essentially one of the strategic voting options available, if you value defining a threshold candidates much get past to be elected over maximizing the odds of your favorite candidate being elected (bullet/FPTP style) or some hybrid of the two (honest voting, with enough strategy to give your favorite viable candidate full points, and your least favorite viable candidate 0 points, along with all your loved and hated \"non-viable\" candidates getting appropriate top and bottom scores, and those you're less passionate about arranged in between by how much you like them, regardless of apparent viability.)\n\nAn argument I've seen a bit of is that fringe candidates could win by being unknown, but I've also seen people say that giving unknown candidates a 0 is dishonest, and leaving them unranked in IRV is better (Unranked is equivalent to bottom ranked, or a 0 in Range voting, so IRV still doesn't win out on this metric) But I would say the two problems cancel out, if the average voter hasn't heard of a candidate, that candidate shouldn't be elected, no matter how much their supporters love them, because that's how you get fringe crazies, so a lot of folks defaulting to 0s for unknowns is basically an immune response to crazies for the Range Voting system. \n\nThere's also been a suggestion that outliers could throw off the results, but I really don't get that argument, since the biggest possible outlier would just be a bullet vote, which gets back to the strategic voting section, and the fact that, yes, an outlier (bullet vote) could distort the election, the the effect of that distortion would be difficult to determine ahead of time, and an opposite outlier (broad approval voting for most candidates, but leaving out a few, anti-bullet voting if you will) would cancel it out. This, the large number of votes cast, and the fact that other voters would be inclined to respond to indications that one faction isn't supportive of any other candidates by isolating that faction, reducing their chances of winning (and if your bullet vote outlier doesn't succeed, you've thrown out your vote, and the outlier is no more). \n\n**Proxy Range Voting**\n\nMy final thought is on Proxy Voting, which would alleviate some of these concerns, while also adding an interesting dynamic to the race. \n\nThe idea is that candidates and even non-candidates could publish their scores for all the (other) candidates, updates as they learn more about them, as they strike deals, as they listen to their supporters opinion of the other candidates, and then those scores would be locked in on election day, and voters could choose to pass some or all of their scoring choices to their trusted candidate, i.e. scoring those candidates the voter knows and cares about, and leaving the rest up to their top pick (or someone else i suppose). Candidates would have strong incentive not to vote in any classically \"strategic\" way, since each point up or down that they give another candidate could represent large swings for those other candidates, helping or hurting them a lot in close races. and so those points could be leveraged to extract concessions, reward even staunch foes for movement in the right direction, and to build bridges between diverse factions. Voters might well take cues from these scores even if they down just let their Proxy pick the scores, looking for candidates that are broadly liked by the other candidates, and then looking at who THOSE candidates are scoring high and low. I have the notion that this exchange of relative strength between competitors would improve the campaign rhetoric, since attacking other factions could hurt you by lowering your score with their voters (even if it's dropping from 20-10/99 it could be enough to cost you the win in a tight race) and praising them, even if they're mostly opposed to you, could achieve small but significant gains. It's not just a matter of convincing people at the margins and turning out your base, it's about building support across the political spectrum (or at least that would be one effective method for winning, which under FPTP and IRV is a recipe for a respectable but thorough loss, unless you can get a lot of first choice, or at least fairly high rank votes.) Being loved on one side, and respected on the other could also be an effective path, but polarizing candidates would have a hard time of it, unless their pole is considerably larger than the other (it's fair to assume there'd be a center/other poll that would be turned off by your partisanship and would prefer a less polarizing candidate from the other side of the aisle, or one who is more eclectic in their positions.) \n\nI've not changed the overall position as stated in the title, but I'm definitely refining both my ideas of how the system could be set-up, and how to address/clarify the concerns people have about it. Thanks to all for bringing up the issues as you see them.\n_____\n\n> *Hello, users of CMV! This is a footnote from your moderators. We'd just like to remind you of a couple of things.

            "selftext": "Boy, reddit will love me for this one.\n\nI'm specifically comparing FPTP voting to other methods which elect a single candidate (ie. not proportional representation).\n\nMy belief stems from the realization that any such system would lead, in the real world, to the same two-party system we have now. The reality is that, outside of the reddit bubble, the two-party system effectively represents a wide range of positions as well as any system can.\n\nPeople imagine that 'breaking the two-party monopoly' will lead to the election of Jill Stein or Ralph Nader. In reality, the mainstream candidates are mainstream for a reason - because they effectively represent the voters. If we have IRV, this race would still be between Clinton and Trump - Just with more distractions. \n\nThe one advantage of alternate systems that I do recognize is reducing the spoiler effect. However, our modern system has gotten pretty good at recognizing and 'eliminating' the spoiler effect, and alternate systems would reduce the stigma of spoilers - we would have more spoiler candidates who are less effective.\n\nThese small advantages, however, must be compared to the increased complexity of filling out ballots, which will eventually lead to many disqualified/unintended votes, especially with the more complex systems, and the 'gaming the system' which poses a big problem with systems like approval voting. **Edit** The most dangerous effect of this is a lack of transparency in the results. Look at the people complaining about delegate allocation for the Democratic primary. When the winner of the election is determined by anything more complex than adding up votes, people can't trust the result.\n\nEDIT: To be clear, I mean that a system with multiple left-wing or right-wing parties will never exist even without FPTP. Parties face other benefits from consolidating, such as preventing intra-coalition fighting and combining data/fundraisin\n_____\n\n> *Hello, users of CMV! This is a footnote from your moderators.

            "selftext": "(when i say america, i mean the USA)\n\nBy ruin, i mean:\n\nDonald Trump is actively promoting policies that will:\n\n1. Ruin America's standing as the worlds economic leader.\n\n2. Ruin America's ability to influence policy around the globe.\n\n3. Get rid of whatever respect western Europe has for America.\n\nThe argument's I i have that I feel defend these statements are:\n\n1. He is suggesting ending significant free agreements, despite the large agreements by economists, (77% of NABE economists think the TTP should either be accepted (47%) or renegotiated (30%)), trumps push to end nafta, kill the ttp, and impose massive tarrifs seem to be widely viewed by economists to be damageing to the US economy. Why anyone would so storngly reject economists consensus, unless they wanted to hurt the economy, makes little sense to me, so i understand his trade policy as desiring to hurt our economy. \n\nAdditionally, trump appears to want to massively increase the debt, his first tax policy (and other policies) would increase the debt by close to 11 trillion dollars over 10 years, when compared to Hillary's policies or current policy. His new one is slightly better, I haven't found any quality evaluations of it though. even if it was only 5 trillion worse than hillary's that would still massively increase the debt to a point where its bad. I am not the best educated on how high the debt can go, but a debt of 34 to 39 trillion dollars seems a bit excessive. The only reasons i could understand wanting a debt that high, given the ease with which America could have a debt closer to 28 trillion, is either from a desire to hurt America, or a desire to help ones self (by reducing ones own taxes as low as possible). However, his tax proposal isnt as low as he can make it for himself, so i am not confident that the latter option is true.\n\n2. A significant part of America's ability to influence global policy comes from our status as providing a nuclear umbrella to many countries. Trump has proposed ending that, and allowing Japan, Saudi Arabia, and South Korea to develop nuclear weapons. This would severely limit our ability to influence those countries foreign policies, as they would no longer require our support to ensure MAD stays true with regards to, say, North Korea. Japan and South Korea would be far more free to act contrary to our wishes, and could start wars without our permission, and our ability to stop them would be severely limited to non-military means. Saudi Arabia is a horrific country, allowing them to develop nuclear weapons would pretty much lead to that kingdom being able to ignore us entirely (which it is close to already, because of the massive power of their oil). The justifications trump gave for allowing this to happen (countering Iranian, North Korean, and Chinese aggression) are completely ridiculous, because our nuclear arsenal is already capable of doing those things to the fullest extent a nuclear arsenal can. The only \"benefit\" we get out of this is that Japan, South Korea, and Saudi Arabia can more freely act against our wishes. That is only a \"benefit\" if your goal is to ruin Americas ability to influence policy around the globe. \n\nAdditionally, his economic policies (refinancing the debt, reducing free trade) seem likely to promote the reduction of the use of american dollars as reserve currency. I feel that USD as reserve currency gives us some power over the countries that use it because of the degree to which our monetary policy effects them. A reduction in that would hurt our ability to influence policy.\n\n\n3. Trump is A) ridiculous at speaking, \"I know words, I have the best words\" etc is embarrassing. Trumps status as a UPenn grad make me believe that he is a far more capable speaker than quotes like that make him appear. However, the sheer commonality of those quotes is unbelievable. Obama had occasional slips of the tongue, bush did too, however the quotes from trump are far less understandable or acceptable, and appear intentional. Whatever quotes make it across Atlantic must make him look idiotic. Additionally, revelations about gitmo and our spying programs have hurt America's image in Europe, trump is in favor of both things. Lastly, his ties to russia/approval of russia must make our NATO allies rather awkward\n\n\n\n\nhttp://files.constantcontact.com/668faa28001/5ac72447-7e42-4a38-90d7-baf2872d0755.pdf?ver=1471625888000 \n\nhttp://crfb.org/blogs/how-much-would-clinton-and-trump-increase-our-19-trillion-gross-debt\n\nhttp://www.breitbart.com/video/2016/03/29/trump-i-hate-proliferation-but-it-would-be-better-if-japan-saudi-arabia-and-south-korea-had-nuclear-weapons/\n_____\n\n> *Hello, users of CMV!

Despite her many controversies over the past few years and especially over the last few months the fact is she is still very much of Donald Trump in the vast majority of national polls (even though that does not really matter because of the electoral college) she is still winning in Florida (+4), Pennsylvania (+5.4), Ohio (+3.3), Colorado(+3.9), Virginia (+5.5),and losing by a very small margin to Trump in Georgia (-1.6) and this may not seem like much but when compared to the polls of 2012 you can really see how shocking this is, Obama was up in all of those states (except Georgia) but the margins are completely different Florida (+0.5)(he ended up losing this state anyway), Pennsylvania (+3.8), Ohio (+2.9), Colorado (+1.5), Virginia (+0.3) and the most drastic change by far Georgia (-10.0) and to make matters worse for Georgia republicans is that there was very little ad before Clinton was seen as a remote possibility, but I only assume that can and will change or already has. based on these statistics here I am convinced (But not without an open mind) that Hillary Clinton will win the 2016 presidential election.   \n\nsorry for the spelling in advance this is the longest post I have made thus far. \n\nlink to a map I made on the great website 271 to win: http://www.270towin.com/maps/Ppg77 \nsource for most of my poll findings: http://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/2016-election-forecast/ \nsource for the 2012 polls of major swing states in 2012: http://www.politico.com/2012-election/swing-state/",

Scientific progress is very important to me, but I feel like I am being internally inconsistent by supporting cuts to military spending, privatization of social security/safety net stuff, etc. The only other thing I would want government to spend more on is (off the top of my head) roads, trains, and other infrastructure. But even that I would prefer spearheaded by state governments with only a few big changes made by the federal system.\n\nI am particularly interested in hearing viewpoints that make the case that scientific progress will do just fine/even better without federal involvement (e.g. left to private universities and companies or bored rich dudes like Elon Musk).\n\nAs random background, I've been left of center pretty much my entire adult life. Through this election I have been reexamining many of my ideas and listening to other viewpoints more and have drifted more toward the middle on many issues.

            "selftext": "I was seeing this video that reddit posted about someone making a parody of Hillary Clinton. In the video the actress was using a computer with a wireless mouse, and some redditor commented on that. The comment got some replies and one of them was \"for God sake, use a mousepad\".\n\nBut I really think they're useless with today's mouses. Even for gamers (the community that most consume mousepads nowadays, due to competitive gaming).\n\nI think it is well known that mousepads had a purpose with the analogical mouses back in the day. The mouses had 2 sets of wheels, perpendicular to each other, that moved the cursor in the X and Y directions. Then it had a metal ball with a rubber coating. The movement of the mouse made the ball move the X and Y wheels. The computer then had to process how much X and how much Y it has moved in a period of time, and the result was shown on the screen.\n\nThis mechanism required that the surface wasn't so smooth because it had to provide friction to the mouse ball. Therefore, mousepads were a useful (yet not 100% required) tool.\n\nBut then we switched to optical mouses, that uses a laser and some optics do determine the cursor's movement. The mechanism now uses a light emitter and a sensor to detect the movement. The requirements are:\n\n1. That there is nothing blocking these components.\n2. The surface should not diffract light, or be transparent (which would produce false data points).\n\nWe didn't change the surface. We still use tables when we are using a mouse. Your mouse now will work just fine without a mousepad.\n\nIf you have a glass table, yeah, you might want one. But just because you are using in the wrong surface. It is like using a ball pen on steel, it doesn't work. But you don't have to use a mousepad. A piece of paper would do the trick.\n\nSo yeah. Gamers say that a mousepad is one of the most important equipment for you, but as for today I think they are wrong.\n_____\n\n> *Hello, users of CMV! This is a footnote from your moderators.

I perceive Bush to have been handled by the party into the war in the Middle East, which had enough short-term gains for invested businesses to offset the long-term damage to the economy.* He is actually easier to deal with as President than as candidate because as President he loses the protection of his voters and the media, and can be impeached (which would be great for ratings).\n\nThe greatest danger a Trump presidency presents would be for Trump to win, and then bring all of his madness (speaking from the progressive side) to a halt and let the Karl Roves of the party install, for example, a hardliner on the Supreme Court. If Trump's circus were allowed to become a reality it would be a (further) disaster for the GOP and a disaster for domestic and foreign trade, and the actual powers-that-be won't condone it. If he wins, he'll either be quickly impeached or he'll reverse his platform and become a generic Republican player to survive in office.\n\nEither way his personality's net effect (with the exception of the Supreme Court scenario) will be minimal. I believe that Hillary Clinton is loathed enough in the US for voters to put Trump in as a \"Never Hillary\" gesture. I don't believe that mainstream America (and its attendant corporate handlers) is actually Glenn Beck enough to tolerate a Trump administration as it's been pitched so far. I only worry about Trump sticking in it long enough to win, and then let himself be manipulated into filling a SCOTUS seat with long-term damaging effects. CMV.\n\n**edit:** Responding because it's been 3 hours & I want to stick to the submission rules. Going over the top-level comments so far there are valid points against the precedent of any candidate winning on fear-/hate-mongering, and I agree that anti-minority rhetoric coming out of the White House poses a real danger to citizens as instigation to violence. \u2206\n\n**edit 2:** Thanks to all commenters so far. I can see my perspective was too narrow on damage that can be done by executive orders, cabinet appointments & the possibility of a Pence administration succeeding an impeached Trump.\n\n**edit 3:** And on damage to climate change progress.\n_____\n\n> *Hello, users of CMV!

            "selftext": "A question was brought to me by an otherwise intelligent individual that has very serious reservations about Hillary Clinton. He pointed out to me that many conservatives think that the Clintons murdered/are murdering a bunch of people who stand in the way of their alleged power grab. Some people \"murdered\" in the past year include a low-level DNC staffer, a guy who wrote small-press Clinton conspiracy tomes, and a lawyer who brought charges against the DNC on behalf of Bernie Sanders supporters. A much more comprehensive list of now-dead people with varying degrees of connection to the Clintons can be seen here: http://www.whatreallyhappened.com/RANCHO/POLITICS/BODIES.php#axzz4JaQz8dHQ\n\nIn my friend's view, the sheer number of people surrounding the Clintons who have died prematurely or in otherwise unusual circumstances is very high, and that should automatically cause me concern and suspicion. I disagree, citing that 1) we can expect people on the Clintons' political level to have a wider array of people tangentially linked to them than a typical person, and therefore we could expect a high body count if we wanted to collect a list, 2) the unimportance and lack of immediate threat of the vast majority of these individuals (e.g. a former intern murdered at her job at an ice cream shop) simply do not warrant murder, and 3) if they did warrant murder, the political risk far, far outweighs any potential gain. Ironically, it seems to me that those who pose the greatest threats to the Clintons are also the ones that it would be most risky to murder... But to then settle for murdering all these relatively unimportant people with no actual power to destroy the Clintons makes no sense at all.\n\nI am completely willing to hear any argument, shred of evidence, or serious/reputable investigation (i.e. not blind, unfounded allegations and insinuation) that suggests the Clintons had anyone murdered, or that any of these people would be worth murdering given the political risk.\n\n\n_____\n\n> *Hello, users of CMV!

            "selftext": "First, let me clarify that I mean this literally. I'm not a Trump supporter at all, I think him and his movement represent everything wrong with America. I think he's a demagogue who garners his support on a purely emotional basis, appealing to people's anger and fear while confirming their (at many times racist) perceptions that Mexicans, Muslims, the Chinese, and everyone in between are destroying the country. If he wins (which right now is not likely, but still very possible), it would be very, very bad. A lot of people will feel unsafe, unwelcome, and most importantly, scared. Their leader, the person who is supposed to provide the country guidance and support, will be somebody who does not have their best interests at heart and will throw them under the bus as long as it makes him more popular with his fans. Internationally, there could be a variety of reactions. People may distance themselves from America. Some may condemn Trump and say we made a mistake. Some may want nothing to do with us anymore. Others could not care at all. But it would in general put us on a very bad standing with the rest of the world, both in how governments and their citizens view us. In short, a Trump presidency would be a disaster.\n\nBut it wouldn't destroy the country. After his 4 years, there will still be an election. There will still be Congress. There will still be the Constitution. We've had plenty of other disastrous presidents and we've survived them. Maybe we didn't come out stronger on the other side, but the country was far from destroyed. I get that Trump is different. But the office of President isn't. There are still limitations, there are still checks and balances, there are still impeachments, and there are still re-election campaigns and term limits. Part of the genius of America is that a President can't make major change by himself. FDR had Congress and the Court on his side. Same with LBJ, and Reagan, and Clinton. They all had to work with the rest of the government. And Trump does not have a good relationship with the rest of the government. Many congressional Republicans refuse to support him, and most of the ones who do do so reluctantly. And what's more, the Democrats have a very good chance at taking the Senate. While I don't think they'll be as obstructionist as the Republicans now, they still wouldn't dare to pass any major aspects of Trump's agenda. He will need to negotiate with them, and from there they will be able to soften many of his proposals. An example is the wall. A blue Senate will not pass a bill to build a gigantic wall along the entirety of our southern border. But if they had to pass something, they would perhaps only decide to build a wall in areas with high drug traffic, or they'd put more resources into vetting immigrants and deporting the illegal ones who commit crimes. And the Supreme Court would strike down many of his ideas as unconstitutional, chief among them the Muslim ban. And even if he does get to make appointments, I think he'd be hard-pressed to find a justice qualified for SCOTUS who would be on board with his agenda, and even if he does, that Democratic Senate can find some reason to reject the nomination. And even if there isn't a blue Senate, it's still most likely gonna be very narrow at the election's end. A near-majority of Democrats plus a few never-Trump Republicans creates a working anti-Trump majority. \n\nTl;dr: Trump alone doesn't have the power to do all the things he says he'll do. He needs to work with the government, and many in the government wholeheartedly refuse to subscribe to his agenda.",

            "selftext": "In my opinion the Black Lives Matter (BLM) movement's message has started to become rather muddled and before it becomes a vacuous mess I believe that it needs centralize around a single feasible social problem that would provide the greatest benefit to the those the group is supposed to represent. That single issue being the War on Drugs. \n\n\nAlmost everything pertaining to the War on Drugs more harshly effects minority groups (most specifically black people). From higher rates of arrest, incarceration, longer prison terms, higher rate of death related to drug activity. One simply needs to look at what is happening in the [City of Chicago](http://heyjackass.com/) and how the violence is [really only effecting one demographic](http://www.intellectualtakeout.org/blog/chicago-75-murdered-are-black-71-murderers-are-black). I am not going to make the claim that ALL of the violence is because of the War on Drugs. However it is clear that a very significant portion of the violence is gang related fighting over territory in order to sell drugs. \n\n\nThe War on Drugs is also responsible for a huge increase in the militarization of the police force. Which has also allowed the police to seemingly ignore the 4th Amendment. These two points are rather self-evident and thus I am just providing a few quick links. In addition to the War on Drugs militarizing the police force, many police tactics used in order to carry out the War on Drugs have been flat out racist with one of the most highlights being [New York Cities Stop and Frisk program.](http://www.nyclu.org/content/stop-and-frisk-data). \n\n*[DrugWarFacts.org](http://www.drugwarfacts.org/cms/Military#sthash.KKVcT5rQ.dpbs)\n\n*[National Center for Biotechnology Information](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4800748/)\n\n*[The Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-watch/wp/2014/03/31/the-drug-war-exception-to-the-fourth-amendment/?utm_term=.b1507f554044)\n\n*[The Cato Institution](http://www.cato.org/publications/commentary/war-drugs-bill-rights)\n\n\nAnother clear problem of the War on Drugs is the [effect it is having on the prison system](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/03/10/war-on-drugs-prisons-infographic_n_4914884.html). Drug offenders have become 50% of the total US prison population, and with the [mandatory minimums](http://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2014/04/a-timeline-of-the-rise-and-fall-of-tough-on-crime-drug-sentencing/360983/) existing many people are being imprisoned on simple possession charges. In addition these changes have begun to sway the make up of the prison population resulting in a majority of those currently in prison being [of a non-white race](http://www.drugwarfacts.org/cms/Race_and_Prison#sthash.ZWmEMK1O.dpbs).\n\n\nThe increase in When people leave the prison system they find themselves with [significantly less rights than they did before hand](http://thelawdictionary.org/article/what-rights-do-convicted-felons-lose/). With the ones they lose being especially integral for them to be able to reintegrate into the society. Restrictions have also been made harsher thanks to the [1994 Crime Bill](http://www.factcheck.org/2016/04/bill-clinton-and-the-1994-crime-bill/). At that time the racial make up of prisons had already begun to shift to a misrepresentation of the US population (which could be seen as making the bill quite racist). Of the deprived rights some of the most important are the [elimination of voting rights, public social benefits, and certain employment rights](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Loss_of_rights_due_to_conviction_for_criminal_offense). With that combination many are not able to return back to their families and without finding a job will find themselves back to the best employer they know, selling drugs.\n\n\nWith what I have laid out I would be very interested to see arguments concerning other issues for BLM to centralize under or if BLM should centralize or not.\n\n\nAlso note I will be around for the next 5-6 Hours and then will be checking back tomorrow. I will try to reply to any thoughtful response. \n\nEdit: Not 100% used to  Reddit format.\n_____\n\n> *Hello, users of CMV! This is a footnote from your moderators.

On one side, I hate the idea of Clinton winning after all the bullshit the DNC pulled to sabotage Sanders and the corruption Clinton represents. I personally believe corruption is the worst characteristic of politicians even more than bigotry and racism because at least you can see the bigotry and racism and attack it directly but you can't attack corruption because it takes place behind closed doors and it just rots society from the inside out. \n\nThat being said, every time I start to warm up to the idea of Trump winning I just need to hear a Trump supporter speak and I lose complete faith in humanity. They just come across as the worst kind of people and I'd hate for such a large group of people I dislike to win anything. \n\nFor example, I feel they are such hypocrites. They are the loudest to cry about free speech and make a fuss when Reddit or a university campus tries to punish them for being politically incorrect yet here they are [supporting a boycott of kaepernick](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskTrumpSupporters/comments/52gln3/does_trump_support_the_right_of_nfl_players_to/) for exercising his right to free speech. How is ruining someone's career for practicing free speech any different than expelling a student for supporting Trump on campus or Reddit blocking anti-Hillary news articles? Disagreeing with someone is one thing but ruining someone's career is just away to suppress their opinion. \n\nThey are very immature. /r/the_donald is like a highschool forum. How can self-respecting adults act like the way they do? I get that it's a just a sub for Trump supporters to have fun but that's no excuse. I'm 29 years old, an independent adult and I try to conduct myself in such a way that reflects that. Sure, I'd love to just let go of all inhibition and play video games all day and act like a little kid but I don't because I don't live with my parents anymore and I have to act responsibly. Just like I don't support my presidential candidate by spreading stupid photos of a frog and dumb buzz words. If you ever visited the /r/Sandersforpresident sub you'd notice it was %95 intelligent productive discussion and %5 shit posting. That pretty much goes for any sub filled with mature minded people. Unfortunately, Trump supporters don't feel the ethical obligation to conduct themselves with dignity when supporting their candidate and I find this troubling. \n\nThey are racist. I'm referring to their obsession with the word **cuck**. I'm sure there are many other cases but this seems to be one of the most blatant. Incase you are unaware, cuck used to be most commonly used in porn and still is to denote white men letting black screw their wives. This correlates with their obsession with white guilt in which they insinuate that liberals will allow 3rd world immigrants to infiltrate their country and rape their women simply due to white guilt. It's a racist term they try to hide under the dictionary definition of the word. I'm not buying it. They keep adopting these extremely racist buzzwords and then claiming ignorance when called out on it. Like the (((echoes))) and affiliation with the alt-right who are openly white nationalist. To me this screams of deception. If Trump wins these people will go full Nazi. If they are doing this kind of shit whilst trying to promote their candidate imagine what they'll do when he wins. They'll probably start waving Nazi flags and claiming it represents the original swastika of the Hindus which represented peace. \n\n\n\n_____\n\n> *Hello, users of CMV!

Here's why:\n\nI think a Trump presidency would be a wake-up call for the US and show the average American that a functioning democracy requires citizens who engage with their government.  It would put America's bigotry and racism center-stage and force us to actually confront it rather than our media's current baby-gloves approach.  I believe Trump would be a completely ineffective president kept in such tight check by the Congress, Courts, and Media that his potential to cause harm would be extremely limited.\n\nAlso, not electing Clinton would show the Democratic Party that just because they are the only party with reasonable stances on social issues, they cannot elect a blatantly corrupt politician to the office of President.  I believe we would see the Dems put up better candidates in the future.\n\nWhile I am seriously concerned about the kinds of Supreme Court Justices we would see Trump nominate, I'm fairly confident that the Congress would be able to weed out the extremists and temper the lasting effects of Trump in the White House.\n\nPlease, someone, CMV.\n\nedit: Thanks for the responses everyone.  I'll be voting for Hillary in November to put my support behind the Democratic Party platform. \n\nMost of you would be well-served by being less condescending.

            "selftext": "The Democratic Party is in some serious trouble. The Democratic nominee, Hillary Clinton, certainly has an edge over the Republican nominee, Trump, but keep in mind: this is Donald Trump. Any other Democratic nominee, any other time, and Trump would be the gloom and the doom of his party. But now he's basically keeping up. Any other time and the Democrats would be rejoicing and anticipating a great continuation of progress and hope. \"Another four golden years!\" We'd say. \"And here's to another eight!\" The longest Democratic reign since FDR. An era of rebirth. \n\nInstead, in the face of imminent victory, all we seem to feel is faux cheerfulness at best and at worst... despair. \n\n\nHow did it get this way?\n\nIt's my contention that the Democratic Party's current shift from the triumph of the Obama election to the apathy and disaffection of the Clinton campaign is not actually very surprising, or undeserved, but the natural by-product of throwing the values of the party by the wayside.\n\n\nWhen Obama was elected, that was great, but the Democrats, so used to failure and so excited at this rare victory, rested on their laurels rather than acting on their beliefs. There was no attempt to hold anyone accountable for the wars on false premises. There was no attempt to hold anyone accountable for torture, or secret hidden prisons, or illegal executions-without-trial via drone strike, or unjustified civilian deaths. And that was just the war. There was no attempt to bring anyone to justice over the financial disaster of 2008 -- the largest crash since the Great Depression. When leaks of massive illegal secret government surveillance were made public, no-one was held accountable. In fact, the Obama government seemed to care far, far more about the crimes that were necessary to leak the information than they ever would about the 1984 stuff. I'm not talking about failures of justice here. I'm talking about failures to even try to do anything that resembled justice on any of these crucial violations. These horrible power abuses, which cried out for the rule of decent law were just... forgotten. Left aside. Dumped. \n\n\nNone of that would have really mattered, except for the 2016 nomination. Bernie vs Hillary, right? Instead of introducing a reasonable array of candidates, including a high-flying former SoS, the election was basically a pit match between Bernie \"the Unelectable Ancient Millennial Mascot\" Sanders and Hillary \"You Know They Wouldn't Actually Let Her Lose\" Clinton.\n\nBut fine, fine. So the Democrats unified. That's good, right?\n\n\nNo. It revealed an increasingly dangerous and toxic culture. The Democrats were taking on an odd mix of entitlement and desperation. When the stuff came out about the email, they basically ignored it. She wasn't going to get indicted anyway, really -- at the end of the day, we all know she's above the law. When it became clear that she \"misled,\" time and again, the FBI of the government she intended to lead, it was basically ignored. Yes, Hillary knew that she was above the law. Yes, she knew that against Trump, all would be forgiven. And she acted on that knowledge, and enjoyed the benefits of being corrupt and powerful in the US. This made a highly public farce of the justice system and put American hypocrisy on display for the entire world to see. And still, when the Democrats were faced with a symbol of all the hypocrisy and elitism they're supposed to be against more than anything... she just had to be elected!!\n\n\nSanders supporters were shamed. Prominent issues, like government abuse, were quieted and went unaddressed. When the Snowden case came up again and the President was asked to issue a pardon... no, of course not. That might hurt her chances. Winning comes before justice now, just like in the GOP. \n\n\nIf Clinton wins, it will re-affirm everything she believes. She is above the law. The law only applies to us little people, and all of us know it. The progessive Sanders people would be tied to a party that would spin increasingly right. The party would become pro-War, pro-spying: in other wars, it would be clear that justice would have no place. The Democrats would be -- and be seen to be -- symbols of despotism, hypocrisy, and corruption. A GOP purged of Trump would crucify them and their absurdly unpopular Madam President. The first woman President would be remembered, not as a heroic icon, but of a dishonest old lady. All that the great twentieth century Democrats built would be lost. \n\n\nTrump, on the other hand, would deliver the kind of shock America needs. His election would not just re-invigorate the political progress: it would wake it up with an airhorn. America would be wide awake, and deadly serious, and get a hard but necessary lesson: never let the demagogues win. The Democrats would get their lesson, too: this is what happens when you leave your principles behind. You lose everything. With the Hillary fever broken, the opposition Democrats could re-affirm their principles and stand up to Trump. The wildly unpopular orange tyrant would be contrasted with a reformed and caring Democratic Party, and the glorious victory that should have been in 2016 would be pushed back a few years, to 2020. And we would learn. \n\n\n**No tl;dr, sorry. The message is simply too big.** \n\n**Edit: downvote for quality, not for disagreement, please please please! Using downvotes as a disagree button makes this entire subreddit more of a circlejerk of popular ideas and less of a place to air new opinions!!!!**\n\n**Edit 2: I have to go for maybe an hour and a half, but *thank you* for your responses so far, and I look forward to continued discussion when I get back on!**\n\n**Edit 3: Okay, what the actual fuck is up with people downvoting my opinions. I have been reasonable, timely, and clear. This kind of downvoting is exactly the sort of thing that kills difference of opinion and makes Reddit worse. Nothing could make less sense in a subreddit specifically about different views. No offense, but if you do this fuck you.**\n\n\nWhat do you think, guys? I'm genuinely open-minded, but I also believe this strongly. Change my view!\n",

It's an issue I've been thinking on and following for a good 10 years now, and I think I've got a good plan, one that hasn't really been discussed at all, and seems to address lots of the issues, and get around many of the objections. \n\n* We institute a tax on political spending, any donation, or in the case of \"soft money\" direct spending in the form of ad buys, or even labor costs for phone bankers or door knockers.  \n* It's progressive on the individuals and institutions with at these rates.  \n * $0 : -$50 (edit from 500, which u/huadpe pointed out is too expensive) \n * $50-$1,000 : 10%  \n * $1,000 - $10,000 : 20%  \n * $10,000 - $50,000 : 30%  \n * $50,000 - $250,000 : 40%  \n * $250,000 -  : 50%\n  \n\n* Notice the $0 : -$50, this means everyone who can legally vote can spend up to $50 on political speech,in the form of donations to campaigns (personal OR issue based) and possibly other political expenditures.     \n* EDIT* possibly just set the voucher amount at some reasonable fraction of the money collected last cycle from the tax based on expected use of vouchers this cycle.\n* The tax money is used to fund the \"vouchers\" and to pay for the elections themselves.   \n* There's a major problem with poorly integrated and underfunded elections, and this would provide a fairly consistent funding source for a department dedicated to running fair, clean, and efficient elections, without lines, without spoiled ballots, with a commitment to fraud detection but ALSO a commitment to giving ANYONE who can legally vote, the ability to vote, without any significant additional burden on them beyond showing up long enough to vote without having to wait in all but the most extreme of circumstances.    \n* It seems more in line with the first amendment, saying that you are absolutely allowed to broadcast your political opinions using your money, but the more that broadcast becomes a major personal imposition on society at large, the more you have to pay back into the society.   \n* It seems fair, since [most people](http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2015/06/02/us/politics/money-in-politics-poll.html?_r=0) clearly feel that large dollar donations are distorting the political landscape in a negative fashion, and taxing social ills is pretty popular even amongst moderate Libertarians and Republicans, who generally can't see a tax without immediately figuring out how to cut or eliminate it. Even Gary Johnson has endorsed a Carbon Tax.   \n\nI think this is a really solid idea, and I also think it's unlikely to happen any time soon, same as I feel about [Range Voting](https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/4yf30w/cmvinstant_runoff_voting_is_only_slightly_better/) .  \nIn both cases, I think we'll see SOME sort of reform in the next decade or so, I just doubt it will be this one. Because no one's talking about either. So.... let's talk about that.\nSo have at it, try to refute it, refine it, or revise it. I'll be handing out delta's for \n\n1-Admittedly, Gary Johnson, (soft?)Libertarian that he is has endorse removing all caps on donations, but requiring they go direct to the candidate, and that it be public, interestingly Stein has essentially endorsed the opposite, requiring all donations be anonymous, and I think small, but certainly no corporations. \n\n_____\n\n> *Hello, users of CMV!

            "selftext": "This is not a typical claim that solely because Hillary Clinton is a woman, all women should vote for her. This is also not a claim trying to bash Donald Trump in all possible ways. However, this is a belief I hold, as a woman, looking to be treated as a human. While in Beijing, on September 5, 1995, First Lady Hillary Clinton, stated \u201cHuman rights are women\u2019s rights, and women\u2019s rights are human rights.\u201d Since then, Hillary Clinton has been fighting to make the lives of women and men equal. Aside from women\u2019s rights she has helped attain healthcare for millions of children, continues to stand up for LGBT rights around the world, and previously ensured 911 victims and response members that they would receive the healthcare and resources they needed to recover. These are few among many of the accomplishments Hillary Clinton has to her name. Her website, HillaryforAmerica lists more and her goals and concrete plans for the future. \n\nDue to her experience and evidence of work completed in the political realm, there is no doubt in my mind that Hillary is the most qualified candidate for the presidency of the United States. However, men and women, as with all candidates, continue to deny the truths about the good she has done and disqualify her due to her personal life and \u201cBenghazi background.\u201d Does it matter for our future if Hillary Clinton really has a bout of pneumonia right now? Does it matter for our future if her husband had a previous affair? The truth is, what matters is often what is ignored. Hillary is ready for stand up for the middle class, she is ready to reform healthcare, she is ready to demand paid maternity leave, she is ready to raise the minimum wage, and she is ready to make college affordable. She is determined to let go of the past and focus on the future; she is not afraid to make the largest investments needed for America. \n\nIt is also my belief that children need to be raised in a world that does not allow only men to set demands with a demeanor that women simply do not have. They need to be raised in a world where sexual and racial inequality does not exist, where all human beings are treated with respect, and a country that continues to be strengthened by the bonds of all ethnicities and cultures. I believe seeing a woman in office will help the youth understand that no dream is too far out of sight. Hillary Clinton previously held the title of Secretary of State, Senator, and First Lady, and has been an advocate for women's rights for many years. This is why I believe she is a qualified woman running for the office of presidency and why I believe that other women should vote for her. I believe she will be able to eliminate the inequalities and double-standards surrounding women because of her experience. However, candidates sometimes do not do what they promise and this is why I am open to learning about why you may believe that she is not that best choice.  \n\n> *Hello, users of CMV!

            "selftext": "For the past 8 elections I have seen that in many ways the candidates from each party have both been in my opinion bad candidates. Each time I felt that if I were voting I would be picking between the lesser of two evils. I voted for the first time in a presidential election in 2012, and I voted for Romney who I saw as the lesser of two evils. Since then I have come to put a lot more weight on how I vote. I now see my vote as putting my name behind that person. Therefor I want to vote for someone who I not only agree with, but that I believe will stick to what their saying on the campaign trail after they have been elected. This brings me to why I can\u2019t vote for Trump. My reasons are:\n\n* He has flip flopped on multiple stances some that I agree with others that I do not (http://www.nbcnews.com/politics/2016-election/full-list-donald-trump-s-rapidly-changing-policy-positions-n547801). Because of that flip flopping I have no idea where he stands for sure on each issue. If he even does have a strong stance on many of the issues, which he very well may not. He seems to pick which ever position will get him the most approval with the audience he is speaking to.\n\n* He believes in multiple traditionally Democratic stances. He supports tariffs instead of free trade. (http://www.latimes.com/opinion/op-ed/la-oe-navarro-trump-trade-china-tariffs-20160721-snap-story.html)\n He supports government paid maternity leave for women. (http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/donald-trump-maternity-leave_us_57d7fe3fe4b0fbd4b7bb5f27)     \n\n* I have no Idea what he\u2019s actually going to do in office. His son has already told the media that Pence would be the one in charge of foreign and domestic policy (http://www.nytimes.com/2016/07/20/magazine/how-donald-trump-picked-his-running-mate.html?_r=0) . So what exactly is Trump going to be doing in office?\n\n* There is a good chance that the Republicans could control congress after this election. If Trump is elected and congress is controlled by Republicans there won\u2019t be anything stopping him from pushing through his policies.\n\nWhile I greatly dislike Trump, I dislike Hillary Clinton even more. I know that she would do very little that lines up with my views. The one upside that I see to a Clinton Presidency is, if the Republicans do control congress, they will vehemently oppose everything she will try to do. This means that most of her policies will be stopped in congress.\n\nAt the moment I see the Libertarian Party candidate, Gary Johnson, as my favorite. The basis of the Libertarian party is people should have the freedom to do whatever they want as long as they are not infringing on other people\u2019s rights. I tend to agree with this view. If I\u2019m not doing something that infringes on someone else\u2019s rights there shouldn\u2019t be an issue with what I\u2019m doing. The biggest issue I see with voting third party is that they have no chance of winning. It\u2019s almost as if I\u2019m \u201cThrowing my vote away.\u201d Many will argue that not voting for Trump is a vote for Hillary or vice versa.\n\nOn top of all this I live in Pennsylvania, which will be a key swing state in the election. This means that my vote could have a more significant impact then if I lived in a state that will definitely go Republican or Democrat.\n\nI have been thinking about all of this for the last four months, since Trump became the Republican nominee. Do I vote for someone I agree with on most topics. Or do I vote for someone I disagree with on most topics but maybe the lesser of two evils. At the moment I\u2019m leaning toward voting for Johnson, but I still have many doubts. I would like to be presented with enough good arguments, facts, and stats to help move me towards voting for Trump.\n\n_____\n\n> *Hello, users of CMV! This is a footnote from your moderators.

            "selftext": "Let me first start off by saying that I consider myself a moderate politically and in most of my thinking on issues.  I am a registered Democrat, and I am planning to vote for Hillary Clinton and for the liberal Democratic Senate candidate in my state.  However, on a major issue (abortion and associated reproductive rights) I now differ from the position that I used to have and that most Democrats have.  I used to consider myself pro-choice (for all of the usual reasons), but over the past few years I have drifted slowly to the conclusion that abortion and actions (including forms of contraception) that end pregnancy after fertilization are essentially murder and thus should be banned in almost all circumstances.  I would add that I am a relatively devout member of a somewhat liberal mainline Protestant denomination (the Episcopal Church), and while religious reasons have influenced my thinking on this issue I believe that my conclusion is reached primarily through the relevant medical information that I have encountered as well as basic logical lines of thought.  \n\nMy thinking runs as follows:  The fundamental question is one of the supremacy of the woman\u2019s privacy rights to choose her own bodily condition vs. the right to life of the unborn child.  Since fertilization is the moment when both parent\u2019s genetic information and material combine to form a new individual organism and the organism is genetically identical from that point on throughout life, it is wrong to intentionally end that organism\u2019s life without their consent (this is operating under the assumption that murder is wrong for many reasons, obviously).  While a person\u2019s (the mother\u2019s) right to privacy is incredibly important, it cannot reasonably be more supreme than the right of another person to their very life.  Based on the ethical standard that people should be treated equally, there seems to be no difference between aborting a pregnancy the day after fertilization and killing an adult or child without their consent.  We as a society do not allow people to be killed directly for the convenience and privacy rights of another person (i.e. you can\u2019t shoot someone who is in your way on the sidewalk), so why should we allow unborn people to be killed for the convenience and privacy rights of another person?  \n\nAs to the \u201calmost all circumstances\u201d in my initial conclusion, I do think that perhaps the situation would be changed if the life of the mother were absolutely in question and it became a matter of preserving their right to life, and perhaps also if the fetus had some irreversible and devastating medical condition that made them have no chance of surviving birth safely.  Even so, I am not totally sure about these unique distinctions; I only want to clarify that I do think there could potentially be some morally acceptable situations where life can be ended after fertilization without consent (such as the above-mentioned special abortion circumstances and perhaps also capital punishment), because in these scenarios it is more than just one person\u2019s convenience and privacy rights overtaking another\u2019s right to life.  I am also new to Reddit and to Change My View (this is my first post), so I apologize if this topic has already been covered before.  I have been questioning and thinking about this issue a lot recently and am open to modifying my views if anyone can make me believe that abortion is not murder or morally wrong, so any help and thoughts would be much appreciated!\n_____\n\n> *Hello, users of CMV!

            "selftext": "Look at me, flipping the dichotomy.\n\nI think that if you live in a \u201csafe-state,\u201d such as California/New York and Alabama/Oklahoma, you should be voting third-party (assuming you are not satisfied with Trump or Clinton, which is the majority of people). By all means, if you have no inhibitions voting for Clinton or Trump, do it \u2013 this argument probably isn\u2019t for you. My logic stems from the nature of the electoral college. Whether a candidate wins by 30% or 0.5%, they still win all of that state\u2019s votes in the college. So, if you live in New York, where there is not the slightest doubt that Hillary Clinton will win, then if you vote for Clinton your vote is wasted since that vote has an incredibly small chance of effecting the end result. This also applies if you are voting for Trump in New York, Trump in Alabama or Clinton in Alabama \u2013 your vote will almost certainly not effect that state\u2019s results. This is why I see votes for major candidates as \u201cwasted,\u201d especially in the light of my next point.\n\nWhen you vote for a candidate, you are not just voting for them to become president \u2013 there are many other aspects to that vote. There is the abstract power of that vote, such as how that vote makes the candidate \u2013 and their respective party \u2013 more influential/legitimate/known/etc. There is also the more material power of that vote. When a candidate receives over 5% of the vote in the general election, which Gary Johnson will likely reach if current trends hold and Jill Stein might reach, they receive federal funding for the next presidential election. Now, the power of that vote is \u2013 again \u2013 wasted on either Donald Trump or Hillary Clinton. They and their parties are already influential, legitimate and known by all Americans (while also being universally disliked). The Democratic and Republican parties also have no problem receiving federal and private funding. Therefore, the power of your vote \u2013 in this sense \u2013 is completely lost when you vote for either of these major candidates.\n\nI live in Connecticut. Here, Clinton has about a 10-point lead over Trump as of my time writing this \u2013 and this has held steady for most of the election and shows no sign of changing. I\u2019ve thought to myself whether my position would change if the race tightened in my own state. After some thinking, I decide it probably wouldn\u2019t. Right now, as I previously explained, voting for Clinton or Trump in Connecticut would be pointless. Surely it wouldn\u2019t still be worthless if the race was statistically tied \u2013 right? Unless the race tightened because of something related directly to Connecticut, most likely Trump would have gained in every other state as well. This would mean the swing states would be painted red and Trump would have the election in the bag, making my vote basically worthless in a whole new way thanks to the electoral college.\n\nI don\u2019t think anybody who is voting third party this November actually thinks their candidate would become president. I would probably join in with you in laughing at them for thinking something so absurd is possible. I\u2019m looking beyond this election, as there is clearly no hope in this one. I have heard many friends of mine say, \u201cYou can\u2019t vote third-party. You have to work in the system we have now.\u201d Well, that\u2019s exactly what I plan to do, I\u2019m using the system I\u2019m given to the best of my ability. My vote is something that cannot be denied by those already in power. The \u201ccorrect\u201d avenues to change that I\u2019m told of almost always involve relying on those in charge to listen and make change for me. This is the one true power that I have, and I want to use it to its greatest potency.\n\nI have never heard of anyone else hold this position before (with these reasons). I\u2019m sure I\u2019m not the first to think of this, but I\u2019m interested in hearing your thoughts. Also, this is my first post on Reddit if that interests you.\n\n_____\n\n> *Hello, users of CMV! This is a footnote from your moderators. We'd just like to remind you of a couple of things.

            "selftext": "From early on in history, men have been viewed as more powerful and authoritative than women. For the past few decades, we\u2019ve been working to create equality between men and women, but even after so many years, men still have an easier time when running for a government position than women do. This is because women receive a higher degree of scrutiny that is typically related to appearance. We are constantly putting more pressures on the females in politics by creating double standards, which makes it harder for women to rise in the political world.\n\nFor example, women are frequently judged based on how they sound which makes it more difficult for them to be viewed in a positive manner. This is very evident in the current U.S. presidential election there are numerous areas where the criticism of Hillary Clinton has been more harsh or shallow, that is to say more related to her appearance or demeanor, than the criticism towards Donald Trump. People get hung up on how \u201cshrill\u201d Hillary Clinton sounds. This causes snap judgments and immediate negativity towards her due to how she sounds, but not because of what she says. For instance, in an article from Time giving advice to both Trump and Clinton for the upcoming debates [x](http://time.com/4471573/debate-advice-for-donald-trump-and-hillary-clinton/), one of the listed suggestions for Clinton is to use a moderate vocal tone. The reasoning given is that voters have never seen or heard a woman\u2019s voice at this level of the campaign and being labeled as shrill will hurt her chances. This is the only piece of advice in the article that deals with how the voters will perceive a candidate and it is not a coincidence that it is given to the female candidate.\n\nIn addition, we place merit on how emotional politicians appear, but the way we view emotion differs when comparing men and women. This is illustrated clearly in a clip from The Daily Show with Jon Stewart [x](http://www.cc.com/video-clips/09yfp5/the-daily-show-with-jon-stewart-the-broads-must-be-crazy---belittled-women). Stewart pinpoints how the media portrays men and women differently, even if they are presenting the same emotion. For instance, when men cry it is viewed as sincere and brave, but when women cry it is seen as a breakdown and a weakness. Viewing women in this light makes it much more difficult for them to get support from the public. In addition, knowing their emotions will most likely be viewed negatively, women in politics have become inclined to show less emotion. Hillary Clinton has mentioned that even though it has been effective for male politicians in the past, she has become skeptical of an emotional appeal because she would be attacked with great fervor[x](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/is-she-likable-enough/2016/09/23/5c8fd252-80e0-11e6-a52d-9a865a0ed0d4_story.html). To put it another way, Clinton is trying to avoid using a political strategy that has worked in the past because she is a woman and knows that means it could backfire.\n\nUsing yet another recent example, Clinton was criticized by the RNC Chair for not smiling at a national security forum [x](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/is-she-likable-enough/2016/09/23/5c8fd252-80e0-11e6-a52d-9a865a0ed0d4_story.html). Clinton responded by reminding us that she was speaking about a serious matter making her lack of pleasure justifiable. The fact that it was even necessary for her to justify her appearance shows just how much women are scrutinized especially in political settings. It makes women appear less qualified to the voters because of the mindset we hold onto which makes us believe men are more suited for powerful jobs.\n\n\n_____\n\n> *Hello, users of CMV!

            "selftext": "Let me just say now that this is not a thread to discuss whether or Donald Trump ought to be president; my view is that he's a national embarrassment, the worst mainstream presidential candidate in US history, and utterly unqualified to hold any public office, and I'm not likely to change that view any time soon. What I want to discuss is the extremely unusual and alarming nature of this election cycle, and what it means for the future of America and the world.\n\nThe tl;dr is this: **Donald Trump has essentially changed the rules of American political culture in such a way that he's completely erased any standards of decency, honesty or credibility from the electoral process.** Things that would have ended political careers before this election cycle have now become so normal with Trump that no one even cares. And that bodes very, very poorly for the future.\n\nWhile [this](https://www.hillaryclinton.com/feed/things-donald-trump-has-said-and-done-that-in-a-normal-election-would-disqualify-a-nominee/) source is obviously biased, it aggregates, using external sources, the evidence for the point I'm making, and which we all understand already: Donald Trump has said and done a lot of insane, deplorable shit and somehow still has a very real shot at becoming president. What the hell is going on here? Remember just four years ago, when Mitt Romney's \"takers\" blunder nearly sank his campaign, and almost certainly contributed to his defeat at the polls? Remember when a single gaffe like that was nearly fatal to a presidential candidate? What the fuck has happened over the past four years? And what's going to happen in the future? As we near the debates, which are all but guaranteed to be a shitshow unlike anything we've seen before, I can't help but wonder.\n\nEven if Trump loses, I worry about the next lunatic, and the next one. Trump has paved the way for more candidates as bad or worse than him, and if he can come this close to winning now, it seems to me like it's only a matter of time before someone of his ilk gets elected. Thanks to Trump, and his supporters, we've entered a bizarre alternate dimension where candidates can lie about basically anything, and no matter how fucking crazy or bigoted they get, it means nothing at all to their supporters. Feelings have completely \"trumped\" facts and logic for a huge portion of the voting demographic. This anti-intellectual undercurrent has been strong in American politics since forever, but I never thought it could get this bad. Nor did many others. We were wrong. And now I'm legitimately worried about the future.\n\n**EDIT: This is not a thread about Hillary Clinton either; she is dishonest but in no way remarkable in that regard. She's far more qualified, and certainly doesn't lie as shamelessly as Trump, or pander to xenophobia nearly as much. This is part of my view that you're not going to change. So if you're going to try to derail the thread, kindly move along.**\n\n**EDIT EDIT: For those disappointed that I awarded a delta, the rules say to award one if someone changes your view \"in some way.\" The poster in question did convince me that I may be overstating the problem, and that the future may not be as dim as I made it out to be. But I nevertheless still hold the concerns outlined in the OP.**",

I think both candidates are great in their own ways - both are talented, (in different ways) both are intelligent (on different levels) and clearly the whole community - the US and the world too - needs both viewpoints. \n(Naturally both have a shadow side and it is okay to criticize each other - but in a respectful civilized way.) I can accept that the no-barrier BS is a much needed stylistic specialty of trumpists. They have no real knowledge about most things or events in the world. So they feel bad and must discharge their stresses. \nIt reinforces  a general sinking of communication level and raising of temperament: a worldwide culture of resentment and aggression. But maybe the sincerity and straithforwardness in it makes it worth - as a learning process it can be useful. Nothing can be done to change that   - so most people are ready to accept it as a given. \nI would like to argue that the lies about the other side ( like the clich\u00e9 that \"Clinton is crooked\" because she used - like all Senators  on weekend - her home server that did not cause any problem as she was cautious enough or the projection that voicing concerns about possible aggression from minorities or out-groups means Trump is \"racist\".) I simply cannot understand how it came about that hundred millions of people are unable to appreciate the huge work a candidate must do to be able to carry the message of half of the population - while clearly we must hear both sides' main arguments. \nAnd how can they speak in a humiliating tone about two worthy and likeable people.\n\n_____\n\n> *Hello, users of CMV!

            "selftext": "In a typical election, a candidate wins a debate by making the case that they'll be a better president, and by articulating the benefits of their positions better than the other candidate. But this isn't a typical election year. Trump doesn't seem bound by the rules of normal candidates; many things that would have sunk a traditional candidate have actually helped him (like the attack on Megyn Kelly, which was one of the most memorable moments of the primary debates). He went from being a long shot joke candidate to the party nominee by dominating media coverage through his outrageous remarks. Every time we heard that something could be the end of Trump, his poll numbers improved.\n\nIt will be the same with this debate. The winner of this debate will not be the candidate who makes the best case for their presidency, but rather the candidate who gains the most attention out of the debate. It won't matter who makes better arguments or who is more factually accurate. All that matters is who's in the news more. And that candidate, regardless of what happens, is bound to be Trump. Consider a few possible scenarios:\n\n1) Trump says something that causes outrage.\n\n2) Trump has a major gaffe\n\n3) Trump is rude to Clinton, by insulting or interrupting her.\n\n4) Trump outperforms expectations and does his best to be civil and look presidential.\n\nIn all 4, Trump wins. In 1) or 2), the clip of what Trump says will be the most played moment of the debate. What Clinton says becomes effectively irrelevant to the post-debate conversation. It's basically the same with 3). The story would be how Trump hasn't changed for this debate. In the case of 4), even if Trump severely underperforms compared to Clinton, the story will be how he's changed his tone and looks more presidential. Even if Clinton performs considerably better, it won't be the main story.\n\nSo, regardless of what happens tonight, Trump, and not Clinton, will be the main story on the news tomorrow, and because of that, he's already won the debate.",

Clinton was filmed to say \"why aren't I 50 points ahead?\", and then Trump and her greeted each other rather cordially for someone who wants the other literally shot. Then goes the debate where he gives all the imaginable wrong answers, cues and implications to the point of even many Republicans, e.g. Rudy Giuliani, are disappointed in him. \n\nWhy wouldn't that be?

            "selftext": "This is not a call-to-action to go vote Clinton.  If you always disagreed with her policies, then keep doing so.  \n\nBut I think the liberals who say \"anyone but Clinton\" aren't being honest with themselves for the real reasons.  I have been one of them.  \n\n**She's Not Progressive Enough**\n\nShe supported universal health care since the 90's and her CHIP program is covering millions of millennials.  Do you think she would've compromised on conservative policies if she had her way?\n\nA lot of it is idealism.  It's painful for progressives to accept that they need to wait on line.  Being the perfect progressive is more wishful.\n\n**Wall Street**\n\nObama had twice the money from Wall Street she got and she's well-liked.  Plenty of Democrats with lower disapproval ratings get big money.\n\n**The Clintons Are Corrupt**\n\nWhich Clintons?  Chelsea?  No, she's well liked and isn't a political figure.  Bill?  He's had high approval ratings and has a higher approval amongst people of all sides of the spectrum than most politicians.  Okay, so it's just Hillary really.  They're not a super-powerful family with generations of wealth.  Bill and Hillary became lawyers and they had 1 child.\n\n**I Don't Want a Dynastic Presidency**\n\nIt really seems like the gambler's luck fallacy, as to where either Clinton would've been non-aristocratic in either scenario.  Is this really relevant in terms of what the policies and results would look like? \n\n**Trade**\n\nBut why is this a recent issue?  Where was the anti-globalist movement before Trump?  Not very far along.  It seems like protectionism is the new trend and free trade is painted as just another way of the old guard trying to keep people down.\n\nTPP was crafted in 2013.   Aversion of it were rare.\n\n**Anti-War**\n\nIf you're genuinely anti-war, that's fine, but I largely think this is used as a defense purely because it's unassailable.  If someone says \"I won't vote Clinton because I can't deal with the bombings of innocent people\", it's untenable to argue against it and therefore the perfect front to cover up an inherent bias.\n\nDo the wars in the middle-east really bother you on a deep level?  Are you politically active against them?  It really just seems like something that's brought up just because it's tough to justify military policy in a few sentences. \n\n**I Hate Politics**\n\nIf Kasich were the nominee, there wouldn't be nearly as much confusion or hatred.  Kasich and Clinton would debate the policies, and yes, fans of each would still be really passionate and forceful, but the two would be able to have a civil conversation without name-calling.\n\nIt would be a straight election.  It would be two establishment politicians and people would pick their side.  Trump presents a crisis in which there is a choice of no prior precedent and it has resulted in a dillemma.\n\n**I Want to Vote Third Party or not vote**\n\nIf you truly feel that way, fine.  But if your stance is \"I want Clinton to win but I won't pull the trigger\", it's a dishonest position (like staying in a dead marriage because of sanctity) You're okay with the decision so long as you don't bear the title.  With voting third party, there's a sense of pride as in \"Hey, I opposed Trump without having to sell my soul\".\n\n**Coolness**\n\nIf you are a millennial, and you support Clinton, people would frown on you for promoting a government they view as oppressive.\n_____\n\n> *Hello, users of CMV!

            "selftext": "The jobs will never come back. Today, robots are as capable as humans. For now, they cost a little bit more.\nThe best medical doctor in the world is software. (see: Watson) Driving is a very complex task with many emergent variables, but the systems are almost ready to take over the roads. The engineers working on that will move onto new and better challenges soon.\n\n\u00a0\n\nAnesthesiologists and pharmacists lobbied congress to protect their jobs in the 90s, because they realized they were already obsolete. Next is surgeons.\n\nNAFTA really was the worst thing to ever happen to the American blue collar worker. We once had an economy that could support itself, but there is no rewinding the tape. Food goods are kept artificially cheap, our government pays $6,000 per household in food subsidies to keep meat and milk on America's tables.\n\n\u00a0\n\nThe economic \"recovery\" since 1998 is largely minimum wage positions. Median wage has fallen $2000.\n\nI have never had a job I personally couldn't design a robot to do, and I am not the cleverest of gents. Soon, management positions will become software and our workforce won't have anything left to aspire to. Soon, schools may become software on tablets. Soon robot police will arrive and be celebrated as the solution to discrimination. Soon high school diplomas will be obsolete.\n\n\u00a0\n\nWe are staring into the maw of automation and it is set to swallow us up, unless we stand together as a single human unit. We cannot afford to be blinded by bigotry. We cannot let politics divide us or believe we can find a savior.\n\nThere are no superheros. Jesus will not come down and make things right with his wizardly ways. New pope is awesome though, I love that dude.\n\n \u00a0\n\nI always hear \"A new industry will appear.\" and they would be right except that there is no wealth in the American populace to support an emergent industry. No new good will meaningfully employ us all. Robots are as skilled as the average human. All \"pick it up put it down\" tasks can be automated. Loading machines, delivering packages, mail, food prep. What do we do when half of everyone is obsolete?\n\n\u00a0\n\nDo we wait until they are starving and find a reactionary solution?\n\n\u00a0\n\nTechnology was the answer, once. If we could all create, buy, and sell digital artworks. Trade software between each other, create physical art and unique fixtures and fittings. Unfortunately our populace is hypnotized by long hours and by falling wages into buying only the cheapest from a big box. There are a few bastions of hope like Etsy and Ebay, but it is difficult to produce high quality goods, and most people are only skilled at following instructions.\n\n\u00a0\n\nMy father worked for $12 an hour roofing in the 80s. Today that's over $30 an hour today. We have been squeezed slowly, until today, the dreams of our youth must either be \"go to college and take on a chain of debt\" or work 50 hours a week and still struggle to house and clothe your growing family. No-one has the time or resources to experiment.  The next new dream is constantly forgotten by the man already struggling.\n\n\u00a0\n\nNo individuals can afford to bring a new tech to market without being captured by the big players, even with huge grassroots support. (see: Oculus Rift)\n\n\u00a0\n\nWealth stratification is worse than before the great depression. We are on the precipice of a bubble collapse. The bubble of nonviolent of poverty. Black lives matter is the face screaming into the tempest. If we squeeze them any harder, its going to get ugly. I don't want to live in a war zone, and I don't want to watch them all get rounded up into concentration camps either. The only reason they haven't lashed out is their oppressor has no singe face.\n\n\u00a0\n\nIf we can't all embrace the socialist inside and effectively harness the engines of wealth existent in this country today, we will all die in poverty and war. If we can't find a way to let every human participate in capitalism, we will find a dystopian police state is unavoidable.\n\n\u00a0\n\nEdward Snowden exposed systems and software that are the gestapo's wet dreams. If things don't make an about face, we will see brutality unmatched since 50 years ago. They are all set up to stomp us all if we get unruly, and they have the tools to do it quietly, despite technology and the internet.\n\n\u00a0\n\nWhat does it mean when large players (see: pharmaceutical companies) begin to pump and dump the economy for short term profits, risking regulation or lawsuit. Are they so confident they are untouchable, or do they see disaster coming and want to get theirs?\n\n\u00a0\n\nBernie Sanders gave me hope, took away my fantasies of walking into traffic. Hillary Clinton stomped on my hope.  She will not effect the change Sanders promised. She will put up a tax here or there, and maybe even reduce college costs, but it will not ease the burden on us all.  She will not take on insurance companies, she will not fix the biggest problems, just patch the easy ones. \n\nShe will not ask the people to come out to support her against congress, while Bernie stated a willingness to call us to the streets, he told us that he would need our help to create a rising tide to lift all boats.\n\nHillary needs only our votes. (see: Debbie Wasserman Schultz) She will pay lip service to any cause to get them, while rewarding her cronies.\n\nTrump will outrage the world, but not enough to collapse it on us. \n\n\u00a0\n\nI badly need a solution other than, \"Hope things turn around.\" I am dying over here. I need to see a world that will not be constantly falling deeper in despair. \n\n\nedit: 2008->1998, removed made up percentage in favor of ambiguity",

            "selftext": "Recently, there has been some debate about what role the moderators should take in a presidential debate. Some argue that the moderator should be more avidly fact-checking the debates, while others argue that such a proposition would be overrun with bias.\n\nHowever, there were a few moments where candidates made statements that are objectively incorrect. It's true, matters of hypothetical policy cannot be objectively measured. However, matters of public record can be. [Here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PlI5l41Hpww) is Donald Trump incorrectly claiming that he has not called global warming a Chinese hoax. [Here's a long list of tweets (plus one video!) where he does](https://np.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/54o7o1/donald_trump_absolutely_did_say_global_warming_is/d83lqqb?context=3) very clearly call global warming a hoax. And for the sake of fairness, Hillary Clinton [absolutely did call the TPP the \"gold standard,\"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q124hZLKpeQ) no \"hope it would be\" anywhere to be found.\n\nMost of these are big talking points, and a candidate has to know that these topics would be brought up. Both Trump saying Clinton called TPP the \"gold standard\" and Clinton saying Trump called global warming a \"Chinese hoax\" are *objectively true statements.* They are on the record. And there needs to be a protocol for that objective evidence to be presented to the public. In both events, the candidate against which the claims were made interrupted with a form of protest. Trump claimed he never said that, while Clinton tried to twist the context into a \"hope it will\" situation, even though that is not how it was delivered. Particularly in a debate like this one, that means no minds will be changed. There is no debate of facts, it's simply he said, she said. Trump supporters will believe Trump is unfairly being attacked, even when it is undeniable fact that he said those things about climate change. Clinton supporters will argue her words were taken out of context, when in-context they don't sound much better. \n\nI don't propose the moderator himself take the role of fact-checker, but both camps should be able to present an indisputable piece of evidence to support them. Instead, they should simply admit or reject evidence presented by the campaigns.\n\nIt's not a perfect solution, and it will change the format of the debates to some extent. However, there are cases where there is objectively correct, and objectively incorrect. Many situations in the debate do not fall into those two categories. However, it's mind-boggling to think that one candidate can say \"I never said that,\" the other can say \"yes you did,\" and the moderator can say \"let's agree to disagree\" and move on to another question. When there is an objective truth, there should be a non-partisan system in place to make it clear to the audience who is in the right, and who is in the wrong.\n_____\n\n> *Hello, users of CMV!

            "selftext": "This is my first CMV, please be kind. This will be a bit unorganized. I'm sorry if this looks like word vomit.\n\nI'm 19 and this will be my first time voting for the next President (obviously), so I'm a bit inexperienced with this whole election thing. I want to think that I can just vote for Trump and it'll be the right thing to do according to my conservative leanings, but to be honest, I find him repulsive. So much so that I'm having doubts that I should vote for him even if he represents my party. Here's some reasons why I feel that way, in no particular order:\n\nI know everybody who runs does their fair share of it, but Trump's campaign seems to rely *too* much on attacking the opposition, worse than anybody I can remember at least in my lifetime. I'm a softie at heart who hates confrontation, so this rubs me the wrong way.\n\nHis proposed ban on Muslims entering the US and \"the Wall\" don't seem like they'll ever get too far. (As a half-Mexican and a person with respect for Muslims, I don't like either idea in the first place.) \n\nOn that note, I don't appreciate some of the things he's said about the country my great grandparents came from. (\"Who's doing the raping?\" etc.)\n\nThere's also some disturbing allegations that he might be creepily interested in his daughter Ivanka, and that alone makes me want to spew. (You can easily Google it if you haven't heard about it) But you don't have to touch on that if you don't want to. I wouldn't blame you, because I think the very thought is just disgusting.\n\nAt the same time, on top of disagreeing with a lot of what she stands for, I feel like I can't trust Hillary Clinton (emails, etc), even though she seems like a nicer person from what I've heard. I really don't want to vote for her either. I understand that voting for a third party candidate is practically useless, too.\n\nIf I vote for Trump and his actions lead to something horrible for the US such as another major war, I'll probably feel guilty for having helped to put him into office. I've also got a lot of years ahead of me so I want to make choices that lead to the best future I can get, of course. \n\nThere's probably not much you can say to convince me that Trump is actually a nice guy; that's not what I came here for anyway. I came here because I need to be reassured that voting for him won't be a mistake.\n\nThis November, I *want* to vote, and vote Republican, but I'm so scared. Please calm my fears if you can.\n_____\n\n> *Hello, users of CMV! This is a footnote from your moderators. We'd just like to remind you of a couple of things.

            "selftext": "Let me start by saying I think we need to elect Hillary Clinton. I am no fan of Clinton but I know her to be the lesser of two inevitable evils. Jill Stein and Gary Johnson are not legitimate options and they present a real spoiler threat to Hillary\u2019s chances. We live under a plurality-rule, first past the post electoral system that invariably marginalizes third parties. I am not a political scientist or a statistician, but I understand Duverger\u2019s Law and the mechanisms of the Electoral College well enough to know we will not see viable third-party presidential candidates unless we fundamentally change how votes are counted. \n\nThat said, I live in Oregon. Oregon has gone blue in every election since Reagan\u2019s victory in 1984. It is an overwhelmingly safe bet that my state\u2019s 7 electoral votes will belong to Hillary Clinton. Oregon is, effectively, sitting this one out, along with 40 other states that have voted for the same party in at least four consecutive presidential elections. My vote will be statistically irrelevant. The only reason to vote at all is to participate on purely ideological grounds. I therefore think the most logical thing to do is to vote third-party to register my discontent. \n\nIf I lived in a swing state, I would find this conclusion wholly untenable. I truly believe we have only two options here and that one option is decidedly less dangerous than the other. That said, I don\u2019t think any critically-minded person can be satisfied with the two major parties\u2019 nominees and that it is up to those of us who live in \u201csafe bet\u201d states to illustrate our displeasure by voting third-party. \n\nMy vote will not change the outcome of the election but it might serve to remind the country that no one is happy with either choice. My role in the election has been reduced to a purely rhetorical exercise, and I believe the best way for me to participate is to cast a \u201cprotest\u201d vote. \n\n\n_____\n\n> *Hello, users of CMV!

            "selftext": "Donald Trump has quite a few problems. He calls Hillary crooked, but he is illegally using his Trump Foundation to enrich himself, he violated the Cuba embargo, possible bribery of an attorney-general (Pam Bondi), he insulted tax payers, he insulted the people that worked for him and subsequently didn\u2019t pay and last but not least his fishy ties with Russia (Manafort, Carter Page). \n\nIf he focusses on Hillary Clinton being crooked, the media will keep go over his business record which is starting to look like a total disaster for a presidential candidate. So it will likely backfire. \n\nIf he focuses on women, he can insult Hillary Clinton for calling out the mistresses of Bill Clinton, feed the conspiracy theorist with possible anti-Clinton allegations and he has the **option to apologize just before the election**. He will be able to **stay in the news** without having to talk about his awful business record and without having to release his tax returns. \n\nIt\u2019s not new that Trump insults women and in the past polls voters didn\u2019t care about it that much. Voters like an anti-establishment candidate and they like alpha males more than they like women. If Donald Trump can stay in the news with something that is not extremely damaging to his campaign (as it is not something new) while jabbing Hillary Clinton with some unproven allegations, he is limiting the damage to his campaign and buying time. The last thing Trump wants is to talk about policies. He is preventing Clinton to talk about policies. \n\nEDIT\nto add a little bit: by staying in the news and insulting women, he is controlling the narrative of the media cycle. The media talks about sex tapes now, instead of policies. That's what Trump wants. \n_____\n\n> *Hello, users of CMV! This is a footnote from your moderators.

Aren\u2019t Republicans still bad for the economy overall? The market doesn\u2019t do as well under them.

            "selftext": "One of the biggest issues for a number of redditors is the Trans Pacific Partnership.  I've read in any number of comments that people consider it the most important issue of the campaign, that it's the only issue that matters to some redditors, and that a vote for (Sanders/Trump/Stein) makes sense because of this one issue.\n\nPeople who feel this way are universally opposed to the TPP, and the general wisdom is that Clinton tacitly supports it - that her public statements opposing it are a lie.\n\nThis stance - Clinton is lying about the TPP - doesn't stand up to rational scrutiny, for reasons I will lay out.  Instead, it's an emotional reaction by people who dislike her personally, and who conflate their dislike of her with their opposition to the TPP.\n\n**1) The most common statement I hear is that Clinton \"will say anything to get elected.\"  Her opposition to the TPP, therefore, is nothing but a cynical move to bring reluctant Sanders supporters on board.**\n\nThis is nonsense.  If Clinton were willing to say anything, there's any number of things she could be saying that she isn't, all of which would appeal to more voters (including Sanders supporters) than the TPP, which 70% of voters have no opinion of at all.  For example, she could:\n\n* support Single Payer Healthcare, rather than her current plan of achieving universal healthcare through a public/private hybrid similar to the French and Dutch systems.\n\n* support free college tuition, rather than her current 'debt free' college plan, which caps at incomes of $125,000\n\n* adopt more isolationist rhetoric, like Bernie's\n\nShe hasn't done any of these things.  I don't see any reason that we should believe her apparent shift of positions on the TPP is calculated, if we can come up with a better or simpler explanation.\n\n**2) As evidence that she is lying, many on reddit point out that Clinton has changed positions on the TPP, that she was originally for it, until Sanders attacked her on it.  This is incorrect.**\n\nWhile Secretary of State, and crucially, while the TPP was incomplete and still being negotiated, she said she \"hoped it would be the gold standard\".  When the full text was released, she looked at the deal, and decided she couldn't support it.\n\nThis is 100% consistent with her record on free trade.  Unlike Sanders, Clinton supports free trade deals in some circumstances - they must have adequate protections for labor and the environment, for example.  She's supported some trade deals that she felt met that standard (like the US bilateral trade deal with Colombia) and opposed others that she felt did not (like CAFTA).\n\nThis is not inconsistent with her statements.  I would furthermore suggest that Sanders position - opposing the TPP before it was finished negotiating, then confirming his opposition mere hours after the text was released - is an intellectually dishonest one, and proves he never would have considered the TPP at all.\n\n**3) Clinton's supporters believe she will pass the TPP**\n\nIt depends who you talk to, and more importantly, if they have talked to Clinton.  Some say she will support it, other say she's against it.  Terry McAuliffe famously said she supported the TPP, but later (less famously) clarified that he hadn't spoken to her about it, and after he did, he stopped saying she supported it.\n\nTim Kaine supports the TPP, as does Barack Obama.  But trade deals are complicated and contentious issues, and absolutely one on which the Democratic Party is divided.  This is not evidence she tacitly supports it, but rather, evidence that she isn't willing to demonize everyone who disagrees with her on this topic.\n\nSo if you look at the weight of the evidence (actual evidence), we see that Clinton's opposition to the TPP is consistent with her voting record, while charges that she's lying are not.  I don't see a reasonable case to be made that she secretly supports the TPP.\n\nWhich is honestly disappointing for me, because I support the TPP.  I don't support Clinton because I think she tacitly supports it; I support her in spite of her opposition, which disappoints me.  I feel like her opposition emboldens the Sanders' anti-trade democrats, who I believe are wrong (and in opposition to science and evidence).\n\n**Lastly, a note about Correct the Record**.  Every pro-Clinton post on reddit is accused by at least one person of being a paid post by Correct the Record.  I am certain I will be accused of being a shill for making this post.  I can say that I'm not a paid shill (I'm not), but of course, that's just what a paid shill would say.\n\nSo instead, let me ask: what does it matter?  If I'm a shill or not, if you refute my arguments for all to see, you'll have struck a mighty blow against paid shills everywhere.  And if you fail to refute my arguments, then they're just as true as they would be if I weren't a shill (I'm not.)

And they should be used for the good and collective advancement of society and humanity as a whole rather than to drive corporate profits. This'd be achieved through a democratic ownership of companies, large Unions keeping all co-opt companies united under a lovely egalitarian society. \n\nCurrently democracy simply doesn't work as it should, Hillary Clinton has the lowest approval rating of any historic presidential candidate, except for Donald Trump. Is this the best one of the richest, largest, most educated and advanced countries can offer? Two rotten, hated, wealthy figures? One who's clearly broken the law multiple times and been exempt from facing justice. And someone who runs on around zero clear policies other than vague variations of racism, against the establishment ideals, a nice hairstyle and funny one liners? \n\nAs the large wealth gap levels down the entry bar for running as a politician would be a lot lower and this would allow for a wider array of educated and capable citizens to lead the country as political discussion and whatnot is encouraged, Unions gaining power give more traction to leftist movements creating more education focused leaders therefore leaving us all with a smarter, happier, richer and overall better society. And therefore a world as a whole.\n\nPlus we'd get to call each other \"comrades\", own Mosin Nagants and ushankas would come back in fashion. \nCMV!

            "selftext": "I'm putting this view forward as food for thought based on my observations the past couple of years. \n\nIt seems to me that in the public-relations obsessed political culture of the UK and the USA being a female politician comes with a particular set of advantages and they relate to the way male politicians are scrutinised by the media and the electorate. Now female politicians do get scrutinised too particularly for their appearance and some aspects of their personal lives but I don't perceive this as being as deal-braking as the judgements male politicians can be subject too. \n\nWith Teresa May, the new PM of the UK, and Hillary Clinton, presidential candidate in the US both polling highly against their male opponents I think the current situation helps highlight the factors working against male political figures: \n\n* Male politicians find themselves caught between two conflicting expectations. This is the result of relatively recent developments in our culture, which concurrently holds two ideas of what men should be like, the 'Traditional Man' and the 'New Man'. One or other of these ideals can be held by separate demographics as well as both being held by the same person.  \n\n* The 'Traditional Man' must be perceived as being 'macho' by many among electorate who hold to traditional gender values. So strong and dominant. This however, may work against them as they could come off as too arrogant or brazen. Trump is a perfect case example for this ideal in action. His 'jock' personality and loud, reckless demeanour are admired by his most ardent supporters, however, as the leaked tapes have revealed these same traits have alienated many and he comes off as a major douche-bag and not a president. \n\n* The 'New Man' is the sensitive, nice, compassionate ideal that more aligns with the values of modern society. However a male politician must tread carefully as not to be seen as 'too nice' as he could then be labelled weak. For some 'too nice' might mean not being 'macho', simple as that. Not being alpha means your a beta. In the UK Corbyn is often dismissed as being weak by members of the electorate for his unabrasiveness. Before him, Milliband was crucified by the media and the electorate for being a 'geek' with 'nothing about him'. \n\n* With the media culture and the electorate choosing to both vilify male politicians who are are 'too arrogant' and humiliate male politicians who are 'too nice' this leaves a very narrow line for men in the political sphere to follow which could risk them falling into the category 'too bland'. It seems in this climate the safest bet for political parties seeking government are female candidates as they can be put forward as nice, kind and attentive without failing to 'measure up'. \n\n* As such, typical women politicians can appeal to traditionalists, most of whom are progressive enough to accept female leaders, as they still honour gender expectations and appeal to progressives for being pioneers first of all and more compassionate, sensitive leaders secondly. Not that they really are that but they can convince enough people while their male opponents are being destroyed. \n\nSo for the time being I hold the view that for as long as the expectations of male leaders remain ambiguous and our media opportunistically pounces on any failure to 'measure up', any female politician would do well to make her move further up the pecking order. There are simply less ways for a woman to fall down than a man in this current political atmosphere, in the UK, where I'm from, or the USA. \n\nFinally I would like to add that I hold nothing against having more female politicians and they being more successful, indeed I see it a good thing and personally would rather see a parliament full of them than full of the Old Boy's Club we're only just shaking off. \n\nThank you for reading and leave you opinions in the receptacle below.  \n\nTL,DR: There isn't one, put the effort in as I have and read at least the bullet points to understand my view.  \n\nEdit: Spelling and grammar.

            "selftext": "I think Trump bombed the first debate, but blew the second far worse, especially considering the stakes. I felt Trump tied or even beat Clinton in the first third of the 1st presidential debate (on the economy), but decisively lost the last 2/3ds. I gave Clinton around a B- for the first debate, and Trump a D-. (For reference, I gave Tim Kaine a C- in the VP Debate, and Mike Pence a B/B+). For the second debate though, I'm giving Clinton a solid A and Trump a solid F. \n\nI honestly think most of the CNN pundits saying he did well are being highly delusional. Or maybe they think that because the expectations for him were so low and he was graded on a curve. Yes, he didn't completely fall apart but that doesn't mean he did well. He really did nothing to help his candidacy, and is still losing. Clinton also effectively needled Trump for elite Republicans\u2019 abandonment of his campaign in the wake of the tape. \n\nI think this is where Trump's whole-in-the-ground expectations come into play. I would say Clinton won, by a tighter margin. She remained cool and composed, was measured and articulate like Pence, while Trump was very rambling, and often avoided questions and got way off script. The moderators held his feet to the fire to make him answer questions directly, and he make himself look boorish and unprofessional by arguing with Cooper so much, and interrupting Clinton, which she handled with tact. \n\nTrump was worse than McCain in 2008 with regards to his body language with wandering around the stage, and seeming to hover behind Clinton is not a good look for him. He interrupted, was nasty, and complained incessantly about his speaking time. \n\nI think he came off as a jumbled, angry, nervous mess consistently, although his worst performance was in the first 40 minutes over the sexual assault allegations. Trump accused the other nominee's spouse of rape, threatened to jail his opponent if he wins the election, and espoused conspiracy theory after conspiracy theory, which the moderators partly called him out for, and which he'll be eviscerated for by fact-checkers in the coming days. And yet, some in the media are calling it draw because he literally didn't light himself on fire. \n\nI thought Clinton explained away the \"public vs private\" position well with by placing it into context (the Lincoln movie), and killed that issue dead in its tracks. Trump came off as unhinged and awkward. Clinton displayed effective political ju-jitsu by pivoting from the WikiLeaks dump to the its source, Russian government hackers who back Trump's candidacy, and relevantly hitting Trump on his pro-Kremlin rhetoric. \n\nOn taxes, he was a mess accusing Clinton over and over with not closing carried-interest, which she dispatched his comment relatively quickly and listing her detailed tax policy. She clarified Trump's plan would increase middle-class taxes, and she wouldn't raise taxes at all on households making $250,000 a year or less. She professionally apologized and took responsibility for the e-mails, while Trump didn't apologize for anything, making him look petty and immature. She articulately defended her 30-year old record and hashed out exactly what she's accomplished (CHIP, healthcare for 9/11 first responders, nuclear disarmament with Russia as SoS, etc.), and then laid out her specific plans for the future. \n\nAlmost every time Trump was cut off, it was in the middle of a drunken-uncle-on-Facebook-esque alt-right rant that was unrelated to the question. At least when Clinton got cut off, it was because she was getting into the weeds of her policies. \n\nFor Trump, I think it was more or less the same stream of consciousness he had last time. Maybe a little tighter but not by much. Clinton's a far better speaker. The visual optics favored her and she looked Presidential and calm, and didn't interrupt him. She didn't control the tone and tenor of the debate, but I think it's best she was restrained instead of attacking Trump more directly. He dug himself in a ditch and got called out by the moderators. She didn't engage in most of the attacks against her, which meant they were in the middle of a long, rambling rant of Trump's and quickly forgotten. \n\nHe was just nervous and angry and awkward, trafficking in hot-air answers. He wasn't as big of a disaster as people thought, and maybe that's why they're praising him. She's done a lot of town halls so her strong performance was to be expected and she actually looked the audience members in the eye and answered their questions directly. \n\nShe looked relaxed, smiled a lot,and laughed a lot (mostly at Trump's awkward attacks). She spoke intelligently and with details. He just looked psychotic, especially when he kept weirdly and randomly name-dropping Bernie Sanders. There's a part of me that is actually amazed at the lack of respect for Clinton's ability to debate, because even her \"canned\" answers knocked Trump out of it before ten minutes had passed. \n\nLast night Donald Trump said: \n\n- He hasn't paid federal taxes in 20 years \n- As president, he will personally pick a judge to prosecute and put Clinton in jail \n- Called Clinton a rape enabler, and Bill Clinton a rapist \n- Doubled down on the \"locker room talk\" excuse \n- Stated he had never done anything like he said on the sexual assault tape. Was condescending and aggressive about the tape, and proceeded to talk over Clinton and made no case for himself \n- Went on rant after rant never answering the question that was asked \n- Got completely lost time after time \n- Continued to display plenty of hyperbole and alt-right anti-Clintonianism, and was very cold to the Muslim woman who asked about Islamophobia \n- Did nothing to reassure women, people of color, or Muslims \n- Sided with Russia and Iran on Syria and explicitly threw his VP pick, Mike Pence, under the bus on the topic \n- Admitted he doesn't really talk with his VP pick that much \n- Admitted he didn't know anything about Russia \n- Had no idea about the legislative process and system of checks and balances (like wrt the carried interest tax loophole) \n- Displayed his sheer lock of policy knowledge and foreign affairs, especially wrt the Syrian conflict \n- Clinton had specific policy plans while Trump ranted about how horrible Clinton was and offering no real plans on his own \n- Pointed like a petulant child saying Clinton's a disgrace and called her \"the devil,\" saying she \"has hate in her heart\" \n- Had no self-awareness \n- accused the moderators of conspiring against him (\u201cthat\u2019s three to one\u201d) \n\nTrump had tons of embarrassing gaffes as well, such as \"perhaps there was no hacking at all,\" \"I don't know anything about Russia, etc. When asked about Aleppo, Trump talked for two minutes about random shits, and Raddatz had to call him out and repeat the question. \n\nThese statements will be the real legacy of the debate. They can all be translated into sound bites and quick clips that will be on the morning shows and attack ads. Fact-checkers at NYT, CBS, PolitiFact, NPR, WaPo, etc., have already decimated Trump on the substance, and his incongruities, blatantly false statements, and ridiculous assertions will dominate the news cycle. It\u2019s hard to find anything Trump said that wasn\u2019t either a lie or highly misleading. Moreover, early polling shows that voters feel Clinton had her decisive victory against Trump. The news cycle is already being very positive for Clinton due to the substance of her attacks on Trump\u2019s policy holding weight. \n\nThis election is over. We need to get used to saying \"Madam President.\" According to an NBC News/Wall Street Journal poll released today, Hillary Clinton has opened up a 14-percentage-point lead against Donald Trump nationally. In a four-way race involving third-party candidates, Clinton leads Trump by 11 percentage points. True, this poll was conducted after Trump's sexual assault tape and before last night's debate. By not completely imploding, Trump may have stanched the bleeding somewhat. But with early polls indicating that voters felt Clinton solidly won the second debate, Trump's extremely unlikely to gain much ground. \n\nThe question now isn't whether Clinton will win, it's whether she can preserve or even expand her commanding lead. As of now, Democrats are set to win both the presidency and U.S. Senate, but Republicans are very, very likely to retain control of the House. But remember, a double-digit win in the presidential popular vote is approximately what Clinton needs for her coattails to be strong enough to flip control of the House to Democrats. \n\nThe worst contrasts where when Clinton answered the Muslim girl vs Trump (her \"stronger together\" message, saying she wants to create an America where everyone feels like they belong), and the question about who is a better role model for youth. Trump came off as a dangerous demagogue while Clinton came off as very presidential, professional, and inclusive. Trump's strategy was literally. deflect, insult, interrupt, negative barb, sensationalize, and sniff loudly. \n\nTo me Clinton remained calm. Trump went all over. To me she seemed more presidential, prepared, knowledgeable, positive, and uplifting. While Trump was negative and evasive. \n\nTrump looked completely out of his depth in places to the point where the moderators had to jump in and force him to answer a question specifically or tell him he was just wrong (announcing battle plans as psychological warfare and/or as a warning to civilians to get out). He said some absurd things (Captain Khan would be alive). He lied about saying he opposed the Iraq War and was called out on it. He was all over the place in most of the questions (Alicia Machado to Benghazi in seven seconds; the Supreme Court question ended with him challenging Hillary to donate $30 million to hersel!!?). I think he brought Paula Jones et al assuming that Hillary would take the bait like he did with Machado and didn't really have a plan B for them. \n\nOne thing I've noticed about Clinton is she will rarely directly go after Trump, even when given the opportunity. She makes it about his temperament, judgment, or policies. She is so even and calm I think it plays well against someone like Trump. I think she made a strategic effort to focus on the issues. Trying to correct all of Trump's lies would have taken too much time. I applaud her for remaining above the fray. She looked at the audience often and engaged with them while Trump was just sniffling away. Clinton had far better answers on unifying the country. \n\nClinton did give great policy statements, too. I really liked her response to the question on energy policy. She acknowledged the security benefits of energy independence, while promoting renewable, clean energy sources and addressing climate change. Clinton displayed a mastery of policy, facts, and logic. I liked her answer on using national gas to transition to renewable energy, and how she'll help coal country adapt. Trump's response on energy was awful substance-wise. \n\nWhatever her flaws, I think Clinton has shown an impressive command of policy in the debates. Every single time Trump litigated the fact that Clinton has been in Washington for 30 years and somehow all our problems aren't gone, he displayed his awful, fundamental misunderstanding of how the federal government works. U.S. Senators don't have autocratic power. And we've been in divided government for the past 30+ years. \n\nI think Trump came off as a petulant, tantrum-throwing child while Clinton came across as professional and even likable (something she's often failed to do. Like, I thought she was nervous and robotic in the first debate, whereas she was pretty calm and confident last night).\n",

            "selftext": "**EDIT:** thanks everyone, you've all made some really interesting points, and I'll definitely be looking more into all of the candidates (including Jill Stein who i didn't even think of!) before giving up my vote! I haven't finished replying and giving out deltas, but I will get to it today :) I also want to make a final one or two things clear about my opinions based on some of the replies:\n\n1. I did not ever think Johnson's use of language was equally as bad as the trump video - my view has been change to consider the use of language not as important as I once thought it was but people seemed to think I thought they were both equally problematic.\n\n2. people seem to think I am a sexist person somehow - I'm going to blame this on my lack of proofreading before I submitted the post in the first place but I really don't think I am - If someone wants to PM me and explain why I'm sexist please go ahead and let me know!\n\n3. The use of fiscal conservative has come up a lot... I need to look into the proper definition but for the purposes of this post I meant I tend to side with democrats on social issues (pro choice, less foreign intervention, more gun control), and with republicans economically (less taxation, less regulation for industry, free-er trade)\n\nand finally, thanks everyone for changing my view!\n\n---\n\nI currently have my ballot sitting in my email inbox (I'm voting from abroad), and while this is the first time I am old enough to vote in the election, there isn't anyone that I can comfortably vote for, especially when we take into account treatment of women (as a woman myself). When I say there isn't anyone, I mean I can't vote for Trump, Clinton, or even Gary Johnson (despite the fact that 3rd parties never win anyway). \n\n\nI don't live in a swing state, so my vote is more of a symbolic vote for myself than anything. I was looking forward to being able to vote for the first time for a very long time, so this is disappointing to me feeling like there is no one to vote for. Obviously the news and campaigns has been very negative about everybody, so I'm really just looking for someone to convince me to see *any* of the candidates in a positive light, and I will count that as a view changed. Give me someone to vote for!\n\n\nonto why I think they're all terrible:\n\n\n**TRUMP**: while I would see myself as a fiscal conservative and would probably vote republican any other election, I think the reasons he isn't a choice right now is pretty obvious. While I don't think he is as much a \"hitler\" as the news and everybody on facebook would have me believe, I don't think I can vote for him as president. I think his plan for bringing work into the country is actually kind of interesting, but obviously his treatment of women has been absolutely awful, and his build a wall thing and the extreme vetting is insane.\n\n\n**CLINTON**: again, while a fiscal conservative, socially I'm more progressive and in terms of economics I *think* hillary is more central than many democrats so ideologically I would be open to voting for her. However, in so many ways she is just awful. Obviously there was the entire email scandal, which bothers me that someone can be so lackadaisical with classified information. She flip flops a lot, so I don't feel comfortable with her saying she wont support TPP, because I think she certainly might. She is very pro war for a democrat and this is something in particular I don't like - I would rather we stop fiddling with the stability of foreign nations. But in terms of treatment of women, I think she is also a poor choice. I am certainly not against having a woman president (I absolutely LOVE theresa may, for example) - but I think her as the first woman president would be sad in a lot of ways. For one, she stayed with her husband after he cheated on her in a very public fashion, and while that is obviously her choice, and shouldn't affect my vote, the way she treated those other women does. She was quite active in dragging those other women through the dirt, when Bill is the one who should have known better. There are a few other reasons on top of this both in terms of treatment of women and Hillary as a politician that are stopping me from voting for her, but I'll leave it at this for now. Ideologically though I can Identify with many of her plans so I am open to being convinced.\n\nand finally\n**JOHNSON**: One the one hand, a little bit useless (read: \"What is a leppo?\"). and on top of that, called Trump a \"pussy\", which obviously, using any form of genitalia as an insult goes against proper treatment of both genders. so its a no go there.\n\nChange my view please!\n\n_____\n\n> *Hello, users of CMV!

            "selftext": "This is my first CMV post so forgive me if it all falls apart but I will do my best. \n\nA number of factors can be attributed to Britain's (IMO) inherently wrong decision to leave the EU. The message was mis-communicated, there was ugliness from politicians on both sides and the UK is seeing a lot of the immediate consequences of that decision already. One factor largely attributed to this decision was voter turnout.\n\nDespite being the 'largest mandate ever' for a parliamentary vote, it is a widely known fact that voter turnout out was greater amongst the older generation who overwhelmingly voted to leave the European Union. This was compared with young people who despite being more pro EU were less likely to turnout and vote. Overall just over 20% of people who were eligible to vote in the EU referendum did not exercise their right.  \n\nNow I am no psychologist but it will probably not come as much of a surprise to anyone reading this that a lot of voting behaviour is based on emotion. Namely, it is often anger, anxiety, fear or pride that may persuade someone to vote in a certain way. There can be many parallels drawn between Brexit and the US elections. Namely efforts of one side of the debate to use fear, anxiety and national pride to try and persuade public opinion. As with Brexit, there also seems to be a lot of negativity flying around Hilary Clinton and her character though evidently being by far the safer and more logical option on paper. Worse still, people are so disappointed with the US elections (as some were in the U.K.) that they are willing not to vote at all. \n\nNow my view: I can foresee Donald Trump winning this election, not because America truly believes he is the better candidate but because people who are like him are more likely to get out and vote for him (I have no stats to support this). People who will not vote at all are supporting his campaign as the vitriol surrounding Hilary Clinton who on paper is the obvious choice of candidate will mean that votes that could have supported her are being cast by people who like Trump. \n\nI appreciate that this argument could be said both ways but looking through a BBC news comment section prior to Brexit is very similar to what I see under a Donald Trump headline. \n\nI would love my view to be changed on this as I believe that democracy can and should work but only if everyone else has their say. \n\nBiased sources: \n\nhttp://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2016/06/24/how-did-turnout-affect-the-eu-referendum-result/\n\nhttps://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voting_behavior\n\nhttp://www.vanityfair.com/news/2010/03/fear-and-loathing-well-anger-actually-in-voting-patterns\n\nEdit: \n\nThank you everyone for the comments, I am looking forward to being a more active member of this sub. One extra point for clarification:\n\n I have no data to clarify this but it would seem to me that Trump's following amongst right and far right supporters is more likely to get him votes (though his loss amongst centre right voters may nullify this gain somewhat). In comparison despite her mandate appearing to be exceptionally large, it is less clear to me just how much support Hilary has amongst the left and far left (who would have elected Bernie Sanders) compared with the centre left (and those republicans who have said they would vote Democrat on this occasion). Again I have no data to back up my observations here, I just think people on the right in this election are more likely to just get up and vote Trump compared to Hilary. ",

Every single day there are hundreds of murders that go without mention in politics, yet those 4deaths have been a political hot button for years. There's been a bigger fuss and festival of finger pointing than there was for 9/11, which killed 6,000 people. With 9/11, it was more or less accepted that we can't know everything and terrorists are jerks. Yes, there was the 9/11 commission and investigations were done, but they never led to people chanting \"lock him up\" or anything of the sort of vitriol that's been leveraged at Clinton. If it weren't for Clinton's likelihood to run for president, I doubt as much of a fuss would have ever occurred in the first place and it definitely wouldn't still be talked about now. \n\nOr do I misunderstand the severity of the issue?",

I agree that they are disrespectful of Catholics, but it's not some kind of all-out assault. And the responses of intense outrage seem to exactly mirror the kind of responses to similar slights that the anti-Political Correctness crowd freaks out about when the charges are racism, sexism, Islamophobia, etc. rather than anti-Catholic bigotry. \n\nYet, as far as I can tell, essentially nobody from the anti-Political Correctness crowd is outraged about the reactions by the Religious Right on this issue. It seems that the anti-PC brigade only really mobilizes when the issues relate to marginalized groups. I feel that this confirms that attacking \"political correctness\" is not actually about freedom of expression or open dialogue, but rather about trying to discredit the idea that there are deep inequalities in the status quo and that they should be addressed and fixed. \n\nA few notes- I know that the anti-PC crowd isn't a monolith, but I feel safe casting them into a general group for this discussion as one might with Democrats or Republicans. And if there has been significant outrage from this corner of politics and I simply have missed it- well that's my own bias showing and if you point me to it I will gladly admit I was wrong. \n_____\n\n> *Hello, users of CMV!

[42% of people are independent voters](http://www.gallup.com/poll/166763/record-high-americans-identify-independents.aspx) whose views are not in strict alignment with either party's platforms. [A third party candidate actually has higher support than Clinton or Trump among independent voters in some polls](http://www.nbcnews.com/storyline/data-points/poll-how-third-party-candidates-could-affect-2016-race-n648266).  \n\nOfficially, the [Commission on Presidential Debates (CPD)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commission_on_Presidential_Debates) is non-partisan. Upon closer inspection, though, the organization has failed its non-partisan mission. Currently, [candidates outside of the Republican and Democratic parties must obtain 15% approval in 5 national polls to qualify for inclusion](http://www.debates.org/index.php?page=overview), which may sound reasonable, but is an arbitrary metric that limits voters to only seeing debates between tickets in the major parties.  \n\nIn order for a third party candidate to even hope for 15%, they would have to have a massive amount of name recognition before ever announcing their candidacy. Even then, it likely will not work. Donald Trump himself could not get into the debates as a third party candidate in the 2000 election, and he is a nominee for president. [He also agrees that 15% is too high, along with Bernie Sanders.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzUKTNJuqhg&feature=youtube_gdata_player)   \n\nThe national polls used for the inclusion criteria [have inherent bias as well](http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2012/05/survey_bias_how_can_we_trust_opinion_polls_when_so_few_people_respond_.html). Even if the most honest team in the world were conducting them, [there would still be a margin of error because every voter in the country cannot be polled](http://www.rasmussenreports.com/public_content/politics/general_politics/may_2015/most_voters_expect_biased_news_coverage_of_2016_presidential_race); however, if this election has shown us anything, the national polls are anything but honest. [A recent CNN poll excluded ages 18-34 from their polls entirely](http://i2.cdn.turner.com/cnn/2016/images/09/05/rel13a.-.2016.post-labor.day.pdf)(page 22 of the report). One of the largest demographics in the country totally left out.  \n\nYour response to all of this may be \u201cThird party candidates are nothing but conspiracy theorists and oddballs. We do not need them on the stage anyway.\u201d Many of them may be odd, but third parties also gave us candidates like Teddy Roosevelt, Ralph Nader, and [Victoria Woodhull](http://www.history.com/news/9-things-you-should-know-about-victoria-woodhull), the first female candidate for president in 1870. Limiting American politics to only Republican and Democratic viewpoints is not just ignorant, it is dangerous to all of us. Put plainly, it severely limits our choices by only allowing only a narrow set of ideas and policies.  \n\nWhat is a fair metric for inclusion in the debates? [I would argue the laws that are already on the books for ballot access are a fair place to start](https://ballotpedia.org/Ballot_access_for_presidential_candidates). States set up ballot access laws to be tough for a reason: it excludes candidates who do not have the support necessary to run a serious campaign. For example, in most states, third party candidates must have a minimum of 5,000 valid signatures to qualify. This number is very difficult to obtain. Volunteers to collect these signatures must dedicate hundreds of hours, and our ballot access criterion is not even the most rigorous among all states.  \n\nIn fact, there is only one ticket outside the Republican and Democratic parties that made it on every state ballot this year out of the dozens of third parties vying for the presidency: [Gary Johnson and Bill Weld](https://www.johnsonweld.com), of the [Libertarian Party](http://http://www.lp.org/). The only other third party ticket that came close was [Jill Stein](http://jill2016.com/) of the [Green Party](http://www.gp.org/) who is on the ballot in 45 states.\n\nMillions of Americans signed ballot access petitions, volunteered, and were polled to be in favor of including these candidates as a choice on their ballots, but the system failed them by limiting their choice. The CPD has a virtual monopoly on debate inclusion that hurts voters.\n\nEDIT: corrected 18-24 to **18-34** for the CNN poll.\n_____\n\n> *Hello, users of CMV!

            "selftext": "1.5-2 years ago most political experts/analysts predicted that 2016 will be Hillary vs. Jeb Bush. Most predicted that Hillary certainly will be the Dem candidate and that she will most likely win because\n\n1. She is more prepared than anyone else. She spend years, if not decades preparing for this and already tried to get the nomination in 2008. She has a large network of donors and an extensive ground game. Plus a lot of support from celebrities and influential people.\n\n2. The US is changing from a mainly white Christian country to a more racially, religiously and sexually diverse country. The Republicans are mainly strong with whites, especially Christian men whereas the Democrats are strong with blacks, Hispanics, educated whites, women, other religions and LGBT. Therefore the odds are against any Republican, especially if their candidate fails to convince other/new demographics.\n\n3. The Republicans have a large share of far right wingers that push their candidate towards the right and away from the center. That makes is hard to win the general election because the Republican candidate has to position himself relative far right to win the primaries and then either shift his position to the center, which means losing credibility and upsetting far right Republicans, or remain relatively far right, which means losing a lot of centrists/independents to the Dem candidate. \n\nSo the only thing that really changed is that instead of Jeb Bush being pushed to the right, it was actually a far right wing candidate (Trump) that won the primaries. Everything else happened exactly as predicted.\n\n1. Hillary won the primaries not because she was extremely popular but because she prepared better than anyone else and basically had the party behind her after years of lobbying and she could mobilize the voters she needed. This advantage continues in the general election, her ground game is far better than Trump's and she can spend more money. She is also far better prepared for pretty much anything (e.g. debates, scandals...). It's basically the small differences that add up and give her a lead.\n\n2. Hillary is also leading because she does well with all minorities and women and, as widely predicted, the Republican candidate is struggling and losing because he can't convince enough people outside the typical Republican voter groups.\n\n3. The only real surprise is that instead of an establishment candidate (like Bush) this time the far right wing candidate won the primaries. However, I think even this victory is overrated. Trump didn't win a 1 on 1 vs. a main stream candidate but rather the rest of the party failed to unite behind one \"anti Trump\" candidate until it was too late. He basically won by \"divide and conquer\", not by popularity. He had the biggest minority, not really the majority. I think he is one of the most unpopular candidates within the Rep party. However, Trump isn't really different from what was predicted. It basically just shows that the far right wing drift of the Rep party is a bit strong than everyone thought, but the effect is the standard the \"Rep candidate is being pushed too far to the right by his own party to win the GE\" situation everyone predicted.\n\nOverall, I don't think the outcome and process is much different from what everyone expected. Hillary will win, as predicted, and the Rep will lose for the predicted reasons. If anything the (likely) clear defeat of Trump proofs that the predictions were correct about the trends and their results. If anything the outcome was clearer than expected.\n\nFor other themes the media often states as extraordinary in the 2016 election I think they are mainly irrelevant or not that extraordinary. E.g. US politics is full of sex scandals. Ironically, Bill Clinton actually proofs that. And other presidential candidates lost because of sex scandals before. Also Trumps populism isn't that unusual either, it's similar to the European far right wing rhetoric. I guess you could claim that it's extraordinary that he behaves like a reality TV show clown but I don't think that's too relevant and there is a general trend towards sensationalism anyway. Also if you go back in history then other candidates actually did make crazy claims too (e.g. that elections were rigged, unfairly attacking the other candidate, over 1000 psychologists declared Berry Goldwater as mentally unfit for president...). Also everyone is ignoring that there we hardly heard any extremely religious rhetoric, which is actually one of the few things that I find pretty surprising about the 2016 election considering how deeply religious large parts of US are. \n\nEDIT. Please no claims like \"Trump isn't losing, this one poll/unscientific polls shows otherwise\".\n\n_____\n\n> *Hello, users of CMV! This is a footnote from your moderators.

            "selftext": "I'm absolutely disgusted by the state of this election. In elections past, at least I could respect both candidates even if I only liked one or neither. I can't remember an election where I couldn't at least respect either candidate.\n\nSo let's go one at a time.\n\nHillary:\n-proven to have broken the law intentionally and willfully\n-got away with criminal activities\n-manipulates the media to intentionally delude Americans\n-rigged the primary\n-pays people to start riots and fights at Trump rallies disguised as Bernie supporters\n-bullied potential rape victims into silence\n-abuses her not for profit charity foundation for political gains\nThat's only the things that are proven at this point. Who knows if she did or didn't have people killed. That's also not even addressing her issues with consistency over the years or any actual policy issues.\n\nTrump:\n-many (albeit unverified) allegations regarding sexual harassment and assault\n-history of blatant lying\n-complete lack of presidential professionalism to the point where that alone could cause massive international issues\n-though often misconstrued, he has made blatantly racist and misogynistic comments\n-completely changed stances on key issues within short time frames to opposite extremes\n\nHonestly I despise Trump, but he has less that's actually proven or criminal going against him.\n\nLong story short, how could you vote for either of these people? A vote for Hillary is saying \"I'm totally fine with this person being able to blatantly disregard the law, get away with it, and deliberately start violence to get her way.\" A vote for Trump is saying, \"I'm totally fine with my county being run by someone who could very easily ruin all of our international relations through being politically inept, as well as being represented by someone who frequently says hateful things.\"\n\nI think both candidates are bad people, and I think it's immoral to support either one of them. CMV.\n\nEDIT: since many people are asking for proof of my claims against Clinton (though I can't help but notice not a single person here has sought to defend Trump), I'm primarily citing the Wiki leaks emails, not just the podesta ones, but also the first batches that came out a while back. I am also citing the O'Keefe video. I know that historically he is far from a reputable source, however one can easily verify all the people in the video are who they say they are and work where they say they work. I am also referring to the FBI emails released today, which were released specifically because FBI agents feel the ruling on Clinton's investigation was not in line with the available evidence.\n\nhttps://wikileaks.org/podesta-emails/\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rh81tPvsjGg\n\nhttps://vault.fbi.gov/hillary-r.-clinton/hillary-r.-clinton-part-04-of-04/view\n\nDue to the sheer magnitude of emails, I can't obviously cite every single one of them. However, if you keyword search most major journalists, emails will come up showing Hillary dictating how she is represented in the publications, down to the choice of words. On top of that, if you look at the section of emails surrounding her hearing, there are several emails where comments are made about being lucky that \"they\" are focusing on the wrong emails, and even comments that heavily suggest she willfully withheld information relevant to the hearing.",

            "selftext": "It is understandable that people identify with one party or another and often vote along party lines. This only serves to perpetuate the problems and frustrations Americans have with the two-party system. Our election system essentially ensures a two-party system, but not all Democrats or Republicans are created equal. By listing the party affiliation of the candidates we ensure that the party, and not the candidate themselves, is the entity that is supported. At the Presidential level, this information is commonly known - for example, everyone knows Hillary Clinton is running as the Democratic candidate and Donald Trump is running as the Republican candidate. While party affiliation certainly comes into play when voting for President, people are exposed to the candidates as people simply due to the media saturation on their character, policies, and backgrounds which also can have significant impact on voters' decisions.\n\nAt the local level, there is FAR less media coverage on those issues. Typically, there are a few commercials that are either smear pieces or fluff pieces but voters have to dig and educate themselves to gain any real insight into those candidates character, policies, and background. So when they plop themselves down in the ballot box a significant portion of the population is just checking the boxes next to the D or the R.\n\nI'm not saying that people shouldn't be allowed to vote straight party if that is what they believe in, but we shouldn't make it easy **not** to educate themselves on the candidates before they pull the lever. It would be ridiculous to put \"Anti-gun control\" or \"Pro Choice\" next to candidates names, so why do we allow party affiliation. It says nothing as to whether they are a \"Good\" Democrat or a \"Good\" Republican, so that information can be just as misleading as any other descriptor you put next to a candidate's name.\n\nBy stripping the party affiliation from the ballots themselves, people will actually have to educate themselves on the candidates they are supporting. If you don't know who someone is or what they stand for, you really have no business supporting them. If you want to vote along party lines, that information is not difficult to find before hand there's no good reason to spoonfeed that information as you're making your selections - in fact, that practice can be more deceiving than not.\n\n_____\n\n> *Hello, users of CMV!

For the sake of simplicity, I will stick to the USA because it's the hot topic at the moment..\n\nWhen deciding who to vote for, the question each American should ask themselves is \"who is going to be most likely to run the country well?\".  \n\nAll these sexual allegations against Trump, and leaked documents implicating Clinton ... they should certainly be followed up on, legally.  And if fault can be proven, they should be prosecuted.\n\nHowever, for the average voter, I don't think it should matter if Trump is a total sleazebag or Clinton is the world's biggest liar.  If a complete sleazebag has better economic/social policies and a better grasp on how to improve the country and its international relations than his opponent, Americans should want to vote for the sleazebag even if the opponent is a saint in their personal life.\n\nThe best headmaster isn't the one who never gets speeding fines.  The best employer isn't the one who has never been arrested for drug use.  The best president isn't the one who has never been sexually inappropriate.\n\n---\nThe main crux of my view that I would like to discuss is this:  Americans ***should*** want to be electing the candidate who is best suited to be making decisions for the country.  Their personal faults and indiscretions are a poor indicator of this.\n\nFurthermore, those who would have their vote depend upon these factors are doing so with superficiality, and are not acting in the country's (or even their own) best interests.\n\n**Edit**: a couple of comments, so far, have made be feel the need to emphasize the following:\nIf Trump is shown to have committed sexual assault, I agree that he is unfit to be president.  And votes should reflect this.  \nHowever, to the best of my knowledge, this is not the case and the benefit of the doubt needs to be given.  Everything out there, so far, are words he's spoken (insensitive, but still just words) and unproven allegations.\nSo, my CMV is referring to the things we know that he has done (e.g. the \"grab them by the pussy\" comment).\n\nEdit 2: Thank you for the comments.  Deltas awarded.  I'm not going to respond to any more comments, because they're almost exclusively \"Trump must be guilty, because several people are alleging it\" and \"a bad person cannot be president, because they're a bad person\".\n_____\n\n> *Hello, users of CMV!

Clinton is broadcasted to be leading in the polls, and a study in recent months has shown that even Trump supporters have been noted to think their candidate is less likely to win the bid for presidency than Clinton, especially Trump supporters who are college educated or in higher income brackets. Clinton is currently the clear favorite in the election, but many Trump voters seem to believe that he's gaining momentum, when in acuality he is losing it.\n\nSo here's the view to change; there is nothing out there that indicates that Donald Trump is going to win over Hillary. This isn't to say he will definitely lose, but at this point in time there's no logical reason to assume he's \"winning\".\n\n_____\n\n> *Hello, users of CMV! This is a footnote from your moderators.

            "selftext": "Now strongly support does not mean vote for.  It does not mean they think they have two bad options and will vote for Trump. Strongly support means you are excited that he was nominated and think he will be a good-great President. \n\nHe has no issue on which he is strong on:\n\nAbortion.  \n\nProbably the best reason for a pro life person to vote for Trump.  However, if you are pro life, you can at best view Trump as tolerable.  Most of his life he has stated that he is pro choice and has described the Republican party as being crazy far right.  And honestly, I'm extremely skeptical that  a Trump presidency would decrease abortions more than a Hillary president would.  Birth control is the most effective means of reducing abortions.  Under Clinton, birth control would be much more widely available than under Trump.  Furthermore, even a lot of pro life judges will respect precedent and refuse to overturn Roe v Wade.  \n\nFurthermore, given that he has vowed to start killing the babies and wives and siblings of terrorists, I don't think he's the right choice for someone who values human life.\n\nEconomic policy\n\nThis is outside my area of expertise so I concede that if you have an advanced degree in economics and you truly believe his policies will be beneficial to the country as a whole and not just yourself I would be open to changing my view.  However, his tax policy, on its surface, seems absurd.  It looks like it will wildly add to the debt.  Now, debt isn't inherently bad, but you need to be investing the resources properly to justify taking on that debt.  This tax cut won't be one that pays for itself according to virtually every think tank.\n\nHe criticizes Obama for TARP and the stimulus yet the overwhelming consensus is that these actions saved us from economic disaster.  \n\nMaybe he is dumbing it down for the viewers,but the way he talks about economic policy seems so uninformed and childish.  He says the debt increased under Obama and GDP growth has been slow and therefore Obama's policies were bad.  That kind of correlation based argument just makes him look wildly uninformed about economic policy.\n\nImmigration\n\nNet immigration has been essentially zero for years.  Rapists aren't pouring over the boarder.  At least before he said he was going to deport the people who are here illegally but he has since back tracked on that.  So he's going to waste tens of billions of dollars on the boarder wall and patrol in order to fight a non-existent problem.\n\nForeign Policy\n\nAgain, he's either a liar or wildly uninformed.  He thinks he knows better than all the generals and intelligence officers which is scary.  He was told that Putin was behind the hack and just chooses not to believe it.  Not listening to people a lot smarter and a lot more knowledgeable than him is perhaps his most dangerous attribute. Which brings me to:\n\nTemperament and overall fitness to be President\n\nHe is either stupid or a compulsive liar.  He claims he knows more than all the generals.  He claims he knows more than all the climate scientists.  He claims there does not exist a single person in the world who respects women more.  He claims if he loses Pennsylvania it will be because it was rigged despite every poll showing him down.  He claims the election is rigged against him even though it hasn't happened yet and he is 7 points down in the polls.  He brags about language that either pushes the boundary of what is consent or is actually sexual assault.  He can't control himself when other people are talking.  He shouts in the middle of Hillary's answers that she is wrong about things there is actual video of him saying.  \n\nHere is a brief list of things he has lied about:\n\nHis position on the Iraq war\n\nHis position on invading Libya\n\nMocking a disabled New York Times reporter\n\nObama  founded ISIS \n\nObama supported al Qaeda\n\nHaving very credible evidence Obama was born in Kenya\n\nUnemployment is 40%\n\nJapan and others should have nukes\n\nThe state dept lost 6 billion dollars\n\nI never told people to check out Ms. Universe's sex tape\n\nDavid Petraeus did far less than Hillary  regarding the emails\n\nThere is large scale voter fraud and the election is rigged\n\nCrime is way up and the cities have never been more dangerous\n\nHe makes Hillary look like honest Abe.  His lies are Bosnian sniper fire level of just objectively false and insane.\n_____\n\n> *Hello, users of CMV! This is a footnote from your moderators.

            "selftext": "Happy fresh topic Friday!\n\nWith the election coming up there are a few things I keep hearing. Mainly that voting third party is a mistake and that they are voting for the lesser of two evils. It is rough to know that, regardless if you are a Democrat or republican that if your candidate does not win, the president will probably be you LEAST favorite choice and is someone you had zero say in.\n\nThis is why I think American Idol style would help. We take the top 10 candidates. Clinton, Trump, Cruz, Burnie, Stein etc. And we vote. The one who gets the least votes is eliminated and then we vote again on the nine remaining. This removes the idea that voting third party is a waste, because if they get eliminated you then get to vote for someone else. It gives 3rd party a chance. It creates a situation that if your favorite candidate does not win your second or third favorite may win. It is over all just better.\n\nNote: I know there is an issue in that we would have to go out and vote nine separate times. For the sake of discussion, let's just say that there is a way to make that work. In other words mentioning that will not lead to deltas.",

            "selftext": "Numerically, more people voted for Bernie Sanders than voted for Donald Trump. However, the negative campaigning brought out more people to vote, leaves a close margin between Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton and high unfavorables for both (sexual assault, WWIII, nuclear war, climate catastrophe, wikileaks, Russian afternoon delight) despite Hillary Clinton winning over most of the Democrats. Hillary Clinton could step down/be asked to step down for reasons from health to potential investigations. In which case a new candidate would be selected (such as Joe Biden, Tim Kaine, or Bernie Sanders, I can't think of anyone else who could possibly be considered vetted). More people voted for Bernie Sanders than Donald Trump in the primary, which doesn't include independents who were taken off voting rolls, couldn't vote, in a state with a closed primary, etc. The Democratic Party should start this process, or everyone should vote for Jill Stein based on her policies, knowing that as a doctor she would have a sensible position on herd immunity and vaccines, and that Congress wouldn't allow anything crazy to happen (unless we had an authoritarian president), especially considering that she'll have to compromise with both parties, who will want to look like they are getting things done.\n\nNote, I'm not looking at how this can happen (as that would require massive funding to break through the media blackout), I'm simply observing that this would be a way to avert rising tensions with Russia, avoid WWIII, stop the world from burning up, keep diplomatic ties with our allies strong, or at least give us an attempt of doing so while gaining a sensible policy in the Middle East.\n\nJill Stein interview: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KCc4CXxxf0g\nWho would replace Hillary Clinton if she had to step down? http://heavy.com/news/2016/09/who-would-bernie-replace-hillary-clinton-if-dropped-out-democratic-nominee-health-kaine-biden-videos-pneumonia/\nI get my data from real politics and the voting totals.\n\n[Edit] So, clearly it's after the votes have begun. And while it's closer than it could be, Clinton is likely to win. It'd be more certain otherwise, and probably Trump supporters would come on board who see a sensible solution that isn't Hillary Clinton. It'd take a crazy change like an election holiday and real electoral reforms for that to happen. So of course, this isn't really going to happen without marches or strikes or something. It's a shame we don't have strong unions anymore.\n\n_____\n\n> *Hello, users of CMV! This is a footnote from your moderators. We'd just like to remind you of a couple of things.

They have also just recently practiced moving 40 million people into bomb shelters.\n\nRussia also hates Hillary Clinton, the candidate who I see as more likely to win the election. Multiple Russian officials have stated that electing Hillary would result in an immediate war with Russia. Even if this war did not occur immediately, tensions would certainly continue to rise and the risk of nuclear weapons use would increase imo.\n\nBasically, tensions seem to be at an all time high, and the direction the US and Russia are heading seem to want to make matters worse, I understand no country wants to use a nuke but the possibility seems to be growing exponentially with time, please change my view.\n\n_____\n\n> *Hello, users of CMV!

            "selftext": "As Hillary has become more likely to win the election and the Democrats have started to open up a large enough lead in downballot races to make taking the House a realistic possibility, [Hillary's campaign has started to redirect resources to downballot races.](http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/nationworld/politics/ct-indiana-missouri-democrats-clinton-coattails-20161022-story.html) However, it is late enough in the election that it is possible that this will not have the effect that redirecting these resources earlier would have had. Obviously, Hillary needed to secure a lead in the presidential race before focusing on downballot elections,  but there is 1 state that she has spent a lot of time and money on that stands out as a state that she could have ignored in favor of helping downballot candidates or spending money in other swing states that are a better fit for her campaign. That state is Ohio, for 2 reasons (if you just want to hear the short version, skip to the end).\n\n1. Ohio is the second-most Trump-leaning swing state after Iowa. Despite his struggles with the state GOP, [he will almost certainly do much better there than he does nationally](http://www.centerforpolitics.org/crystalball/articles/why-trump-will-do-better-in-ohio-than-he-does-nationally/). Even with a normal candidate, Ohio is usually one of the more Republican-leaning swing states, and Trump's message is tailor-made for it. [The state Democratic Party is in shambles.](http://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2015/11/weary-from-losses-ohio-democrats-try-to-rebuild/457977/) [Ohio ranks as the state that has the 13th lowest percentage of residents with a college education in the country.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_U.S._states_by_educational_attainment) [81.1% of the state is non-Hispanic white.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ohio#Demographics). The Republicans had their convention there. It is just a terrible fit for Hillary's campaign, Hillary could easily win without it, and the resources that her campaign is spending on it would have been far better spent on states that are more critical to her ability to win the election.\n\n2. Usually, when a campaign is spending money on a state that it doesn't need to win, it is to help downballot candidates. That is not the case with Ohio. [Ohio has no competitive House elections this year.](http://cookpolitical.com/house/charts/race-ratings) [Neither chamber of the Ohio State Legislature has a chance of flipping this year.](https://ballotpedia.org/State_legislative_battleground_chambers,_2016) [Other than the Senate race in Ohio, there are no statewide elections in Ohio this year.](https://ballotpedia.org/Ohio_elections,_2016), and [that Senate race has been leaning heavily Republican since mid-August](http://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/2016-election-forecast/senate/ohio/). So basically, even if Clinton wins Ohio, it will mean nothing. In contrast, if she spent that money in Indiana, Missouri, North Carolina, Florida, New Hampshire, Nevada, Pennsylvania, Wisconsin, Colorado, Michigan, Virginia, Iowa, Arizona, Montana, Minnesota, New York, California, New Jersey, Maine, New Mexico, Alaska, Utah, Illinois, Washington, Kentucky, West Virginia, Vermont, Nebraska, Texas, or Kansas, she'd be helping out downballot candidates more, because there is at least one close gubernatorial, House, or Senate race in all of those states or a close race to control a state legislative chamber. By spending money on Ohio instead of in areas where downballot candidates need help, Hillary's campaign is weakening the Democratic Party's efforts to succeed in downballot elections.\n\nBasically, Ohio contributes nothing to Hillary's campaign. If she wins it, it probably would mean that she had already gotten 270 electoral votes from other states, and if she loses it, it is still relatively easy for her to win. Even if she does win Ohio, it won't help any downballot candidates win their elections. Winning Ohio would just be a meaningless cherry on top of a Hillary victory, and the resources that it takes to win Ohio would thus be better spent on states that Hillary needs to win or where downballot candidates need support.\n\n_____\n\n> *Hello, users of CMV!

            "selftext": "Ok-I'm fairly, hell let's say super confident that I am more knowledgeable about nuclear weapons than Donald Trump, which would not be a big deal usually, except he potentially could have the launch codes for them in several months. \n\nTo begin, I know more about nukes than your average joe. Studying them has been a personal hobby of mine, and I took a class about them from a top level university, and met my professor every week to discuss with them more on the subject. I know the general blueprint of a gun type bomb, the potential destabilizing effects of MIRVs, nuclear ambiguous posturing, boomers, KT and MT yields, why you can't make a nuclear bomb from just yellow cake uranium, deterrence, MAD, Waltz and Sagan, ect. Point is, I'm pretty well read in the field. \n\nHowever, for all I know about them, I'm ridiculously under qualified to be commander and chief on that point (assuming I was competent in everything else). Hell, I'm not even knowledgable about them to get a good job at certain think tanks. And I admit this freely. \n\nWhich is why when Trump demonstrates his rambling answers on nukes, the fact that he does not seem to grasp what the triad is, that Russia is 'expanding', that our forces \"have fallen behind\" (bull, we have roughly the number of nukes as the Russians, not to mention far superior and numerical aircraft and boomers) or rambling on about first use (he kept trying to say that he would be unpredictable, but at the same time not use them first, which is a very bad policy. He was unaware of our current policy is ambiguous on first use, not because of deterrence for ourselves per se [You can still deter a nuclear attack with a no first use policy], but for our allies. If say, the Chinese were preparing to attack taiwan [treaty ally] and we were not confident in our ability to beat them back conventionally [thanks to their 'carrier killer' missiles] we leave it open to use tactical nuclear weapons as a last resort to defend our allies, which helps cement our security guarantee and deter attacks on our allies. That is why I was so impressed with Clinton in the first debate when that came up, as she immediately said America will defend its allies [but didn't explicitly say we will use nukes, because that is bellicose and saber rattling]) is so scary to me as a voter. \n\n\nNot to mention his comments (and muddling around with) on Japan and SK with nukes is horrifying (if either thought that the nuclear umbrella was not absolute, they might try to create their own weapons, and say goodbye to the NPT) \n\n\nI'm not interested in talking about the ethics of nuclear weapons in general (I'll save that for another time), I merely think that it is crazy that I know a damn sight more about the most destructive things in human history than the man who just might control them, and I'm not even that learned about them. When the nukes are the cornerstone of our military, not knowing about them in significant detail (I.E. more than a 20 something Uni grad who didn't even major in them)\n\nI'm not attacking trump on anything else but this issue for this question.\n\nI'm also not interested in discussing Clinton. I'm confident she know enough about nukes.\n\nTL;DR- I know more than the average joe on nukes, but not enough to be trusted with them as all. I know more than Trump, and he might get control of them.....WTF?\n_____\n\n> *Hello, users of CMV! This is a footnote from your moderators. We'd just like to remind you of a couple of things.

            "selftext": "First of all, I would like to say that I'm not supporting either candidate. In my opinion, neither has the structure to become president, or deserves to get the job. And I also recognize that, regardless of who is elected, the world won't end. Now:\n\nThe 2016 election year has seen a breakdown in civility unmatched in recent history. And the bulk of this is centered around Donald Trump. Now, I recognize that Donald isn't the best candidate, and may not even be a good person in the most absolute sense, but that doesn't excuse violence directed at his supporters. And there has been violence. \n\nIn many parts of the country, it isn't safe to be a trump supporter. Trump supporters have been attacked, beaten, have had things thrown at them and faced vandalism. If Hillary is elected, these people will be vindicated.\n\nChildren at trump rallies have been screamed at and spit on. If Hillary is elected, these people will be vindicated.\n   \nMinorities such as Latinos and gays who support trump, as is their right as US Citizens, have been attacked with rocks. If Hillary is elected, these people will be vindicated.\n\nDonald's Trumps star on the Hollywood walk of fame, a thousand-dollar piece of his property, has been vandalized three times, first with cardboard, and then with spray paint, and then with a sledgehammer. Wether or not the perpetrators have been or will be caught is irrelevant: If Hillary is elected, these people will be vindicated.\n\nA the North Carolina GOP headquarters was firebombed only a few weeks ago. It got next to no mention in the media and was entirely forgotten about pretty much instantly, which means that in America, the land of the free and home of the brave, it's OK to firebomb your opponents, if they're Republican of course. Wether or not the perpetrators have been or will be caught is irrelevant: If Hillary is elected, these people will be vindicated. \n\nWhen I heard about the firebombing, I was honestly scared for the future of america. Is this what we are? Is this OK now? And I became angry because I *knew* it would't get press. Imagine if a Hillary office got bombed: It would have been front-page news on every paper in the nation, and gotten a FBI investigation. But since it was a trump office, no one cares. What if I had been there? I don't support trump, but I could if I wanted to because all Americans have the right to vote. Would my life be worth less depending on my political party?\n\nI'm a minority, by the way.\n\n**TLDR:** If Hillary wins, everything bad done not by her, but by her supporters, will become the new standard.\n_____\n\n> *Hello, users of CMV!

However, when I imagine Hillary as President, as imagine a massive kicking of the can down the road: Congress will again be recalcitrant, her trustworthiness is not likely to improve, her husband will undoubtedly bungle something and embarrass her/us, and the enthusiasm of \"first female president\" will soon give way to the un-enthusiasm people like me generally feel for her.  In sum, the next four years may very well be a blur.  On the other hand, a Trump presidency -- precisely BECAUSE he's extreme, blunt, and foul -- would require a long-awaited reckoning from Republicans and would prompt what may eventually amount to a healthy dialogue on what values this country thinks are sacred for the next generation and beyond.  In other words, while Clinton would be \"more of the same,\" Trump would force the country to take a hard look at itself and decide what kind of country we want to be in the 21st century.  This is what I mean by \"clarifying.\"  Meanwhile, there are two other branches of government to keep a check on the power that he so ignorantly thinks is concentrated in the presidency.   ",

For him not to notify Congress that this evidence existed would have been a breach of this pledge.\n\n* On the matter of timing: consider that if he waited until after November 9 in order not to cause undue influence on the election, and then it became known that he had kept this information from the public, it would have become much worse for Clinton (as it would then have lent credence to the Trump claims of a \"conspiracy\" to elect Clinton, and seriously undermined her ability to govern).\n\n* On the issue of how vague his statement was: he really didn't have any alternative, since it seems like the FBI really doesn't have any idea yet of what was in the emails and may not even yet have a warrant to read them.  It wasn't Comey's original letter that was responsible for creating the distorted impression that the media reported as a \"bombshell\" on Friday-- it was the media itself (and by extension, the members of Congress who leaked the story to them) who chose to report its contents dishonestly.\n\n\nUltimately, I think we should be holding the media more accountable for the way that this story has blown up out of proportion to the known facts, and recognize that Comey was just doing his job.\n_____\n\n> *Hello, users of CMV!

            "selftext": "First of all, I will say that I am not a Trump supporter. I am an independent with some liberal and some conservative leanings. I am very torn about who to vote for in this election and I see both candidates as equally terrible in their own ways. I might even vote for a third party candidate. \n\nBut let's tackle the obvious of why Trump is terrible. He is openly racist, sexist, and Islamophobic. He has won appeal through fear mongering. He has bankrupted somewhere between 4-6 of his own companies. And he has NO political experience. \n\nWith that said, here is why I think Hillary is terrible. While Trump has no experience, her experience has been bad experience. With regards to the whole email situation, I actually don't care about that too much. What I care about is that she is a warmonger. She supported the war in Iraq in 2003. She supported intervening in Syria, Yemen, and Libya -- and now these places are disasters. \n\nSo while Trump has bankrupted at least 4 companies, she has helped in the destruction of at least four whole countries. \n\nShe wants to put a no fly zone in Syria, even though the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff General Joseph Francis Dunford has warned both the US Senate as well Secretary of State John Kerry in no uncertain terms that a \u201cNo Fly Zone\u201d over Syria would lead to war with both Syria and Russia. And many of the Democrats I've talked to have defended this by saying, \"Well Russia doesn't want a war with the U.S, she would discuss this with Russia before hand.\" But here is the thing about wars. In most situations, no one wants a war. In 1914, none of the countries in Europe wanted war. Wars happen as a result of a string of events that build up hostility and tension until the point that war is unavoidable, and we're getting to the point where this will be the case with Russia. America cannot afford a war with Russia. In the worst case scenario, if things go nuclear, they have more nukes than we do. But even if tensions don't go nuclear, this still has the capability to be an immense economic strain on the U.S's already limited resources. \n\nHillary's support for arming rebels in conflicts has also indirectly resulted in the creation of ISIS and other terrorist organizations. \n\nNow Trump has said that he wants to stop America's failed policy of nation building, while Hillary seems interested in continuing with this course. Trump is also interested in a peaceful relationship with Russia. And I don't really care about the possibility that Russian hackers tried to interfere with U.S. elections, because the reality is that most countries (including the United States) are spying on one another electronically. That and the U.S. interfered with elections in Ukraine against Russia's interest. So they really aren't doing anything that we don't already do. What is also dangerous though is that Hillary has said that she would possibly use military action against those who commit cyber warfare against the United States [Source: The Hill](http://thehill.com/policy/cybersecurity/293970-clinton-treat-cyberattacks-like-any-other-attack).\n\nNow when it comes to the things that Trump has claimed he will do that scare people, I doubt he's actually going to do a lot of these things. I highly doubt that he will deport 11 million illegal immigrants from the United States. This would be devastating for some of his own businesses. I doubt he would have the political power to do this. And it would be a task that would be very difficult to implement. I do think he would build a wall, but I don't think a wall is as big of a deal as people make it out to be. And the fact that he'd limit immigration of people from countries involving current conflicts (like Syria) doesn't really impact me on a personal day to day basis, aside from keeping me safer from a possible terrorist leaking into the Trojan horse of refugees entering this country. This has happened in Europe already where some of the refugees have identified people among them who were involved in ISIS. \n\nI believe that what America needs is a focus on infrastructure, jobs and friendly relations with Russia in order to help stabilize the Middle East. I feel like Trump would at least be helpful in these respects. \n\nSo in this election, I see it as a choice between a military imperialist and a nationalist. Neither are great. But military imperialism is what ends up destroying most major empires in history. Rome spread itself too thin in doing this as well as Democratic Athens. While a less militant, more nationalistic America would focus on other world powers as partners in trade, rather than potential military adversaries.\n \nMy worst fear with Trump is that in his stupidity and incompetence he would blow up the economy. \n\nBut my worst fear with Hillary Clinton is that she would drag us into a war with a nuclear super power.\n\nIn this regard, I feel like Trump is actually the lesser evil. But I am definitely open-minded to being proven wrong, because while seeing him as a lesser evil, I am definitely no fan of him at all. \n\nEDIT: Need to leave the house for something, but I'll look at more of these when I get back. Keep posting! Lots of great, well thought out points here. I'll read more when I get back and decide if I'm going to award a delta or not. \n\nEDIT 2: I need to think for a while if my view is changed or not. I'll at least know by election day! But I'm definitely getting swayed by these arguments.  \n\nFINAL EDIT: So I'd like to say you all have successfully changed my view and I will award you all a \u2206...Can I do that? Hillary's aggressive policies still scare me, but you all have done a good job of pointing out to me that Trump has the capability to be just as aggressive/destructive, except with him it could be worse because he has a tendency to lash out and punish people over minor slights, and no one has any ability to control him (not even his campaign staff). So he'd be an unguided missile -- literally and figuratively.\n_____\n\n> *Hello, users of CMV! This is a footnote from your moderators. We'd just like to remind you of a couple of things.

In conversation with people of faith, the only answer I get is \"but...abortion!\" -- which does not seem to resolve my concern. I can understand that abortion is a significant justification for evangelicals voting in pro-life candidates, but no reasonable person can deny the political expediency of Trump's new views on abortion. \n\nSo, if one is not in denial, the way Trump has made a living and how he lives his life shatter the foundations of christian principles. How can one be a devout evangelical christian that follows the teachings of Jesus Christ and not be hypocritical by voting for Trump? I am not saying they vote for Clinton, but on paper it seems she's ironically lived the more pious life.\n\n_____\n\n> *Hello, users of CMV! This is a footnote from your moderators.

Conservatives/Republicans claim that the media doesn't cover the newest Hilary Clinton corruption developments and that they deliver biased and exagerated narratives of Trump's past and present misdeeds, while liberals/Democrats claim that the Trump can get away from media criticism and is held to a lower standard than Clinton is, and that stories of Clinton's corruption are at best speculative and at worst lies to get page views. Both of these narratives cannot be true simultaneously.\n\nAccording to this septeber 2016 Gallup poll, 51% of Democrats and 14% of Republican contribute to a nationwide 31% fair amount or greater trust in the media, which is the lowest it has ever fallen for as long as the poll has been taken. Independent analyses of media bias tend to show that in general, most main stream sources are a little left of center, and that presidential election coverage has been both positive and negative depending on the salient issues of the week, with no actual bias detectable.\n\nWhen people complain about generalized news bias like \"the liberal media\" or \"conservative conspiracies popularised by the news\", they are complaining about a phenomenon that doesn't exist. News companies cater to different audiences along the political spectrum, but because there are so many negative stories about both candidates, it is wrong to say that in this election cycle the news is more or less biased than in the past.\n\nTo change my view, I want to see proof or reasoning that the bias people claim exists is different than the existence of factually correct reporting on news stories that are simply negative for our candidates.",

            "selftext": "\"Plan Colombia is the name of a United States military and diplomatic aid initiative aimed at combating Colombian drug cartels and left-wing insurgent groups in Colombian territory. The plan was originally conceived between 1998 and 1999 by the administrations of Colombian President Andr\u00e9s Pastrana Arango and US President Bill Clinton, with the goals of ending the Colombian armed conflict and creating an anti-cocaine strategy.\"\n\nI am currently discussing this with somebody and I believe that there are no real benefits of this anymore, only detriments.\n\nMy points\n\n- Waste of money\n\nWe give $644 million to Columbia each year. and in the end, the goals of the plan are not being met. Firstly, human rights violations are not decreasing, as NGOS report that Colombia has the fourth-largest population of internally displaced persons. Secondly, the actual drug reduction goals re not being met. Cocaine production isn't decreasing. In fact in 2013 coca cultivation began to rise, estimated 39% increase in 2014. Most of this is in FARC (a militant group) controlled territory.\n\nAdditionally, a key part of Plan Colombia was the aerial spraying of phosphate on crops, hover, this was was banned by Colombian authorities last year. We're just throwing money away as nothing is being achieved.\n\n- Land conflict\n\nCurrently U.S is im a land dispute with Colombia, but despite this we continue to send billions in aid.\n- Sexual assault from U.S Personnel\nThe only thing we achieve by sending military personnel there is harm towards their community. You can make the argument that this happens to wherever we send U.S troops, but in other cases, we are actually getting something done. Here, it only hurts the communities.\n\n- Lack of accountability\n\n- Drug use has decreased, no benefit\n\nSimilarly, cocaine has decreased in popularity since the the time when the bill was passed. At they time period, cocaine was extremely popular, but now, people are very unwilling to try cocaine.\n- Colombia needs to stand on it's own\nA huge part of the money is going to humanitarian aid. We're basically funding their society. They need to fix their system and figure out what direction to take their country, because right now,t he only thing they are known for is cocaine.\n\n- Landmines\n\nThis military aid portion of the money is used to buy landmines. These landmines are placed near urban centers and the majority of the casualties from these landmines have been women and children.\n\nIn conclusion, we're just wasting money by keeping this plan alive. Not only that, but we are hurting the local people more than we are helping. \nSo, why should we keep such a detrimental plan alive?\n_____\n\n> *Hello, users of CMV!

I think enlarging districts and the click-based (rather than subscription-based) nature of news on the internet has made this aspect many times worse, and has warped the US' ability to propose qualified candidates. Rather than reforming the news, likely a violation of the first amendment and I believe a futile fight against the natural progression of technology, and the current court's belief that election reform can only be carried out by a Constitutional majority, I think we should focus more upon producing qualified candidates in the first place.\r\rFurthermore, scientists' solutions to present problems are meaningless if a government does not have the capability and foresight to adopt new ideas that seem feasible. A scientist who wishes to improve the world, say for example a scientist who develops a food additive that reduces cows' production of methane, is directly reliant on a politician who has the free time and resources to drive narrative for them.\r\rI think the federal government should allocate financial resources to the development and sponsorship of schools of public policy in every state, a sort of decentralized system of the sort that turned China into the preeminent power in the world until Opium and guns led to its' downfall.\r\rI think, if properly decentralized, a system of schools of public policy that say, give massive election financing to top ten graduates (using matching funds or multipliers, maybe) would do a great deal to improve political discourse and robustness. Money is becoming a greater and greater driver of political success (as Trump and Hillary aptly illustrate - one has the trump brand, the other the Clinton brand), and if it is not feasible to take money out of politics because Roberts thinks money can't be excised from speech, why not sponsor qualified candidates, rather than letting candidates rise upon their own meager financial resources.\r\rHope to hear your thoughts.",

It is effective at making them money.\n\nLet's say Clinton wins. If their chances for her are above 50%, then in the eyes of the public they still predicted the \"correct\" result. If their chances for her are above 40%, they could easily argue that she won the dice roll, and they wouldn't lose very much.\n\nLet's say Trump wins. FiveThirtyEight has consistently had the most optimistic chances for him. So they gain reputation here 100% of the time. Compare with PEC which gives Clinton a 99% chance. If Trump wins, Sam Wang and his grad students are gonna have to close shop from the reputation hit.\n\nSo regardless of whether or not the FiveThirtyEight model is good or not, the site stands to gain by having a more volatile model. It generates more stuff for their writers to write about, and drives more traffic. Nate Silver and ESPN are gonna make money off of that site no matter what happens.\n\n_____\n\n> *Hello, users of CMV! This is a footnote from your moderators.

Policy proposals are nothing more than campaign rhetoric designed to sound good and get votes, so I don't care about them either. \n\nHumor me and set those things aside for the moment and focus on Russia.\n\nRussia is the most powerful military power after us. They can tremendously hurt us...without even using nukes. Why is Hillary Clinton so anti-Russia?\n\nAccording to her, the various WikiLeaks revelations come from the \"highest levels of the Russian government, clearly, from Putin himself.\" Trump himself is a \"puppet\" for the Kremlin. Russian hackers will undermine the integrity of the election itself by hacking our voting systems. I'm not aware of any credible evidence of any of this. Please tell me if you know of any.\n\nShe's been pushing for a no-fly zone in Syria. She wants it despite knowing it would \"kill a lot of Syrians\" and that it would require direct confrontation with Russia ([see General Dunford's testimony](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fmE9Jj-rEVs), for instance). She's citing humanitarian reasons right now, as she did with Libya, but those turned out to be phony.\n\nNATO is deploying huge forces to eastern Europe along the Russian border. Britain sent a fleet of fighter jets to Romania and 800 troops supported by tanks & tactical drones to Estonia. America sent 330 troops to Norway, along with 900 more \"battle-ready\" troops & armor to Poland. Canada and Italy are sending 590 troops to Latvia. Germany is sending 600 troops to Lithuania, supported by additional forces from the Netherlands, Norway, Belgium, Croatia and Luxembourg. In sum, 10+ countries have deployed 4,000 troops across the Baltic states right at Russia's borders. Russia has every right to feel intimidated.\n\nNow I'm not saying Russia is innocent, because it isn't, but the US has recently invaded more countries than Russia has, most for shaky reasons. Syria invited Russia to help it fight ISIS. It didn't invite America there, but we're there anyway fighting on Al Qaeda's side to topple their government. WTF? \n\nIt seems like the whole world is gearing up for serious war for reasons I don't understand. \n\nWhy can't we work with Russia? Aren't we united against ISIS? Why are we promoting anti-Russia sentiment in America? Why are we mobilizing huge resources to counter Russian aggression? Where is this Russian aggression that threatens the west anyway?\n\nShouldn't the prospect of war with the second-largest military power (who'd likely be allied with the world's third-largest military power, China) be a bigger campaign issue than it is?",

            "selftext": "So pretty much, this website  https://trumptraders.org/trade/about.html hooks up third party voters in swing states with Clinton voters in safe states and tells them to trade votes. This ensures the third party candidate number stays accurate to support, but ensures Clinton cannot lose swing states because of the third party voters. I find it highly unethical (full disclosure I'm not voting for Trump and do not want to see him in office). Even if you could ensure the person you are trading votes with does what they say they will, which you cannot, I just see this as a total slap in the face of democracy. You are essentially taking the power from some states. If a state's natural voting outcome is to give its electoral college votes to Trump then that is what should happen. If this happens because third party candidates are popular in that state then so be it. If a candidate does not have enough popularity in that state to be elected outright, they should not be elected. I do not want this to turn into an argument on why the electoral college sucks so try to keep the focus on vote trading, thanks in advance for the conversation! \n\n_____\n\n> *Hello, users of CMV!

But if your goal is to improve the system by voting for Trump is not the way to go about it. I hope that *after the election* the DNC is forced to reform for its actions in the primaries. The risk of Trump becoming president is simply too high to risk challenging the system now.\n\nI would have been a Sanders supporter but I would have happily support Romney or even Pailin if it came to that. I am even willing to accept it as a given that Clinton has illegally accepted funds and has acted criminally (with regards to emails or anything short of murder). I still would vote for the option of [\"random voter\"](http://jpupdates.com/2016/09/19/philosopher-sam-harris-fires-salvo-at-trump/) than Trump. This is what made me think of Flavor Flav.\n\nI belive that Flav would realise how out of his depth he was and the White House would effectively be run by either party's administration.  \n\nAs for Trump's policies, I see his policies to be demagoguery; I don't believe he'll stick to a single policy. Not the wall, not the undocumented immigrants. I believe that he would say that he'd turn in to a chicken if he thought he'd increase his chance of winning.\nEven if a handful of his policies might be appealing to me, I have to throw the baby out with the Trump bathwater. \n\nThe idea of Trump being preferable because he hasn't been \"bought\" by lobbyists or foreign interests also does not convince me. His refusal to hand over tax records and his business actions give me no confidence that Trump would be more likely to act in the best interest of the American people, his conscience or act in a way that doesn't serve his interests. \n\nThe reason why I am most concerned is that I believe that Trump is actually dangerous. Although the military administration have stated they would refuse an unjustified order to launch nuclear weapons, this is not something I think this is a game of chicken the world should be playing.\n\nPlease, help me change my view\n_____\n\n> *Hello, users of CMV!

            "selftext": "First off, I understand that the word \"fascist\" has been misused for decades by people as a sort of slang term for anyone they perceive to be an evil figure of authority. That is not what I am saying. This is 100% serious and Godwin's law does not apply.\n\nMy argument is that Donald Trump's entire campaign is based on fascist principles, thus making him by definition a fascist.\n\nBecause Fascism is by its very nature deceitful, it is hard for academics to agree on a rigid set of \"fascist\" principles. That being said, most historians are able to agree on certain fundamentals that fascist regimes have had in common.\n\n[This article](https://ratical.org/ratville/CAH/fasci14chars.html) from 2003 brings forth 14 key features that fascist movements have had in common. There are plenty of other resources that say basically the same thing, but I don't want to overcomplicate things, so I will base my argument off of these 14 points.\n\n1) Powerful and Continuing Nationalism\n\n   >\"Fascist regimes tend to make constant use of patriotic mottos, slogans, symbols, songs, and other    paraphernalia. Flags are seen everywhere, as are flag symbols on clothing and in public displays.\" \n  \nThis one is the most obvious, and doesn't really require a lot of explanation. Trump's campaign relies on a mythical view of America where everything is perfect and nobody was hurting for money. The trouble is, that was never the case. Trump has managed to stir up aggressive nationalists and sympathizers by doing what is essentially psychological racketeering. He's creating a problem that doesn't exist (America not being great), so that he can reap the benefits of people who are willing to buy in and let him fix it. This is the same strategy Mussolini, Franco, Hitler, Erdogan, etc. used.\n\n2) Disdain for the Recognition of Human Rights \n\n>Because of fear of enemies and the need for security, the people in fascist regimes are persuaded that human rights can be ignored in certain cases because of \"need.\" The people tend to look the other way or even approve of torture, summary executions, assassinations, long incarcerations of prisoners, etc. \n\nTrump has suggested \"bombing terrorist's families\" and torture. After [The Central Park Five](http://www.nytimes.com/2016/10/18/opinion/why-trump-doubled-down-on-the-central-park-five.html?_r=0) were acquitted of murder, Trump refused to pull back his statement that the men (who were exonerated by DNA evidence) should be executed. Trump has spent his entire campaign attempting to delegitimize the free press, and has successfully convinced a significant number of people that literally everything on the news is false, and that only he is telling them the truth. This was a tactic implemented by the Nazis in the 1930s, known as [L\u00fcgenpresse](http://time.com/4544562/donald-trump-supporters-lugenpresse/). I am not referring to this one incident as my evidence, just as background on what it means. Trump doesn't say that word, but he conveys the exact same message. Trump has shown a propensity to take legal action against anyone saying negative things about him, and has even said that he wants to be able to more easily sue news stations for (\"libel\")[http://www.npr.org/2016/03/24/471762310/donald-trump-wants-to-open-up-libel-laws-so-he-can-sue-news-outlets]. This is concerning not because he doesn't want people telling lies about him, he doesn't want anyone saying *anything* negative about him at all.\n\n3) Identification of Enemies/Scapegoats as a Unifying Cause \n\n>The people are rallied into a unifying patriotic frenzy over the need to eliminate a perceived common threat or foe: racial , ethnic or religious minorities; liberals; communists; socialists, terrorists, etc. \n\nThis one is obvious. The Hispanics are taking our jobs, black people are responsible for all the horrible crime and all they do is take from hardworking americans, the muslim refugees are sneaking into our country to kill us, Obama is a secret muslim terrorist, Hillary Clinton is a baby eating satan worshiper. The point is that the fascist hears these fears from a common person who is rightfully pissed off about not getting a fair shake, and plays on that by directing their attention away from the real root of their problems to meet their own personal goals. There is no stronger motivation than hatred. The people lose sight of what's really wrong and start to lash out.\n\n4) Supremacy of the Military \n\n>Even when there are widespread domestic problems, the military is given a disproportionate amount of government funding, and the domestic agenda is neglected. Soldiers and military service are glamorized. \n\nDonald Trump wants to beef up military spending, bomb whoever, and encourages the deification of the military into a mythical organization of heroes with no care for the actual character of any individual military member.\n\n5) Rampant Sexism \n\n>The governments of fascist nations tend to be almost exclusively male-dominated. Under fascist regimes, traditional gender roles are made more rigid. Opposition to abortion is high, as is homophobia and anti-gay legislation and national policy. \n\nWe've all heard Trump's misogyny a million times on the news, so I won't bother repeating it. But when we have a [person running for a public office](http://www.mysanantonio.com/news/local/article/Texas-Ag-Commissioner-Sid-Miller-calls-Hillary-10445369.php) who feels entitled to publicly call a political opponent a \"Cunt\", it shows Trump's ability to normalize something that is absolutely not normal, like a complete lack of respect for women.\n\n6) Controlled Mass Media \n\n>Sometimes to media is directly controlled by the government, but in other cases, the media is indirectly controlled by government regulation, or sympathetic media spokespeople and executives. Censorship, especially in war time, is very common. \n\nYou can make the argument that this is already done by the Democrats but just because you have a cough doesn't mean you have lung cancer. It's hard not to see a connection between attacking *all* news as being biased and untrustworthy and the desire for an \"unbiased\" news source. What is an \"unbiased\" news source anyway? If you want all your \"unbiased\" information to come from one place instead of having to put the pieces together yourself, you want controlled mass media.\n\n7)Obsession with National Security \n\n>Fear is used as a motivational tool by the government over the masses. \n\nKind of goes along with 1 and 3. You are under attack, and I am here to protect you.\n\n8) Religion and Government are Intertwined \n\n>Governments in fascist nations tend to use the most common religion in the nation as a tool to manipulate public opinion. Religious rhetoric and terminology is common from government leaders, even when the major tenets of the religion are diametrically opposed to the government's policies or actions. \n\nLike Mussolini, Trump has no use for religion other than as a political tool. It's clear he does not, and may have never actually read the bible. He has simply aligned his official policies with that of the Evangelical religious establishment. Mussolini did the same thing with [Catholic Church](http://www.historylearningsite.co.uk/modern-world-history-1918-to-1980/italy-1900-to-1939/mussolini-and-the-roman-catholic-church/). \n\n9) Corporate Power is Protected \n\n>The industrial and business aristocracy of a fascist nation often are the ones who put the government leaders into power, creating a mutually beneficial business/government relationship and power elite. \n\nDonald's tax plan would be a love letter to large corporations who have to burn through a lot of resources to avoid taxation.\n\n10) Labor Power is Suppressed \n\n>Because the organizing power of labor is the only real threat to a fascist government, labor unions are either eliminated entirely, or are severely suppressed. \n\nPeople like Donald Trump don't have to worry about a revolt from the working class finding out who has *really* been ripping them off when they can so artfully pit white working class folks against working class minorities.\n\n11) Disdain for Intellectuals and the Arts \n\n>Fascist nations tend to promote and tolerate open hostility to higher education, and academia. It is not uncommon for professors and other academics to be censored or even arrested. Free expression in the arts is openly attacked, and governments often refuse to fund the arts. \n\nThere is a lot of hate that gets thrown around by the Trump demographic about \"Liberal Universities\" and how they're just brainwashing people. It doesn't matter that outside of the financial burden, education as a whole tangibly improves your living circumstances. Higher education helps develop stronger critical thinking skills, which are crucial in sifting through alarmist rhetoric to get to the facts. We can see [here](http://www.wsj.com/articles/hillary-clinton-leads-donald-trump-by-4-points-in-latest-poll-1478440818) that in the latest Wall Street Journal/ABC poll, Donald Trump is going to be the first republican nominee to lose the vote of college educated white people since polling records began being tracked in the 1950s. There is clearly something about what Trump is selling that simply does not mesh with the views of educated people, regardless of their traditional political values. The platform is based around things that are objectively false. The kicker is that Trump surrogates like [Newt Gingrich](http://www.forbes.com/sites/startswithabang/2016/08/05/newt-gingrich-exemplifies-just-how-unscientific-america-is/#f94fb3928328) and Rudy Giuliani consistently appear in media and intentionally muddy the waters with a \"feelings over facts\" strategy. \n\n12) Obsession with Crime and Punishment \n\n>Under fascist regimes, the police are given almost limitless power to enforce laws. The people are often willing to overlook police abuses and even forego civil liberties in the name of patriotism. There is often a national police force with virtually unlimited power in fascist nations. \n\nFascist leaders always have the support of a partisan law enforcement service. What does it say when [84%](http://www.policemag.com/channel/patrol/articles/2016/09/the-2016-police-presidential-poll.aspx) of police (an occupation that is big on unions and is considered pretty Democratic) go for the guy that openly talks about how [crime would go away if police were just \"tougher\"] (http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/ct-trump-chicago-police-crime-met-20160823-story.html)? He says he wants to [implement stop and frisk nation wide](http://abcnews.go.com/Politics/donald-trump-calls-nationwide-stop-frisk-policy/story?id=42261880), which would only put cops in more danger, and doesn't seem to care that it was deemed [unconstitutional](http://www.nytimes.com/2013/08/13/nyregion/stop-and-frisk-practice-violated-rights-judge-rules.html) several years ago.\n\n13) Rampant Cronyism and Corruption \n\n>Fascist regimes almost always are governed by groups of friends and associates who appoint each other to government positions and use governmental power and authority to protect their friends from accountability. It is not uncommon in fascist regimes for national resources and even treasures to be appropriated or even outright stolen by government leaders. \n\nWhat is Donald even doing in this race other than trying to serve the interests of his family? What was Donald doing [giving a gift](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/trump-denies-he-talked-with-florida-attorney-general-about-donation/2016/09/05/e15d62e0-73b8-11e6-8149-b8d05321db62_story.html) to an incumbent state at the same time she dropped an investigation into his Trump Foundation?\n\n14) Fraudulent Elections \n\n>Sometimes elections in fascist nations are a complete sham. Other times elections are manipulated by smear campaigns against or even assassination of opposition candidates, use of legislation to control voting numbers or political district boundaries, and manipulation of the media. Fascist nations also typically use their judiciaries to manipulate or control elections.\n\nFascism has varied from leader to leader. Donald Trump can't rig the United States election. It is not logistically possible to rig our election due to its decentralized nature. What he can do though, is attempt to delegitimize the democracy we are founded on in order to create confusion and ultimately destabilize the structure of our election system.\n\nBonus Point/Conclusion.\n\nTrump is fiercely anti-globalist. He has repeatedly called to withdraw from our position as a worldwide economic and social leader, specifically in relation to NAFTA and NATO. Trade is bad because the Chinese are preying on us because we're weak, he says. We need to bring manufacturing jobs back, he says, with no mention that basic economic theory teaches that an increase in the cost of labor results in an increase in the price of goods. If there is one thing that fascism is *really* about, it's the belief that the nation is so strong that it doesn't need to engage anyone on the outside.\n\nIn order to change my view, you would have to convince me that  \n\nA) Donald Trump is right, and Hillary Clinton and her cronies have truly been defrauding the United States government\n\nor \n\nB) There are circumstances in which the political views that he espouses have an application outside of an authoritarian pseudo-democracy.\n\nor \n\nC) Something I am missing entirely about this whole sh*t show (Which is possible) I like to hear different perspectives.",

            "selftext": "I did a quick search on the Republican party in this subreddit and found a lot of similar but not exactly the same subjects, so I hope this post is different enough to be in line with the subs guidelines.\n\nMy basic premisse is that the Republican party will fail, at least until the next election cycle, to learn the lessons it needs to learn to continue to be viable as a presidential party (I just realised that I am basicaly assuming a Clinton win here). They do not believe that there is anything wrong with their positions, they believe they have an 'optics' problem. Furthermore, especially after this election, the republican base isn't going away, and the party itself might be too tainted to be acceptable to a significant number of democrats. And finally, the republican party and media will continue to function under similar incentive structures. All these factors prevent substantive change on the short to mid term (1-2 elections at least). \n\nLet's start of by taking a quick look at the 2012 autopsy report. While I believe that report came to some accurate conclusions, the language suggests they fail to realise the extent to which they need to change their positions. Take for example the oft quoted line: \n\n\"If Hispanic Americans **perceive** that a GOP nominee or candidate does not want them in the United States (i.e. self-deportation), they will not pay attention to our next sentence.\" (emphasis mine, [source](http://talkingpointsmemo.com/dc/6-big-takeaways-from-the-rnc-s-incredible-2012-autopsy))\n\nThe key word being *perceive*, not that the Republican party has an actual and current history of disenfranchisment, xenophobia, and racism, but that it is *perceived* that way. Or take the following line:\n\n\"Already, there is a generational difference within the conservative movement about issues involving the treatment and the rights of gays -- and for many younger voters, these issues are a gateway into whether the Party is a place they want to be,\"\n\nOnce again, I don't see an acceptance of gay people, but more of a 'lets not talk about this anymore', we will still accept homophobes into the core of our party. In short, they seem to believe that they have a perception problem, and thus fail to acknowledge the bigotry that is quite central in their party. This bigotry has become abundantely obvious through this election cycle. Trump voters a.k.a. the Republican base, don't care about conservative issues, as evidenced by the unwavering support of the Republican base for Donald Trump. \n\nEven someone like Glenn Beck who's doing his best right now to pivot to the center, talks about Michelle's speeches as effective, not because republicans are sexist, but because Trump makes it *seem* like they are what Democrats have been saying they are: sexist and racist. Again showing a fundamental lack of understanding of the Republican base.\n\nNow, one might counter this line of arguing by pointing to candidates like Rubio and Jeb(!) as an attempt to broaden the base to include Hispanic voters. But, as we all know, these efforts failed miserably. Which brings me to my second point: the Republican base won't go away, especially now. They are more then before, distrustful of the Republican establishment. Which is why Trump won, and why any future republican will still have to appeal to the far-right republican base. This prevents any substantive enlargements of potential republican voters. So even if Republicans wanted to, they couldn't change significantly without also losing the base. And I suspect a lot of Democrats won't be voting for Republicans in a while.\n\nFinally, some words on the incentive structures within the Republican party and media. There is a lot of big donor money propping up conservative hosts from Koch Brothers-types looking to push anti-government and regulation sentiment. Same goes for Republican candidates like Scott Walker. Moneyed interests within the party will still be pushing for dangerous and outright stupid fiscal policies and endless tax cuts long after Trump is gone. This makes it even harder to pivot towards policies that are popular amongst the general public. \n\nA fundamental misunderstanding of the bigotry within the republican party, combined with an increasingly extreme Republican base, and incentive structures that prevent responsible policies taken together make significant change within the Republican party highly unlikely. \n\nI do think there is an awareness that something must change amongst a lot of Republicans, I just have little confidence they will truly be able to do so on the short term and would like to hear some good reasons to think otherwise. ~~If~~ when Donald Trump loses, the Republicans will come back and pretend as if Trump never happened. There are already some early indications of this, like the rumblings about not electing a new supreme court judge from the likes of McCain and talks of Clinton indictments the moment she gets in office. Instead of changing, this whole cycle seems to have been about doubling down.\n\nEdit1: Some language corrections\nEdit2: more of the same\n\n> *Hello, users of CMV!

She jumped on that train pretty late, even for a Democrat. She was firmly against gay marriage, and her recent emails suggest she may still be.\n\nThe War on Iraq. Sure, many politicians got this wrong. But Clinton was, IIRC, pretty vocal on this. Only 20 Democrats in the end did vote against the War on Iraq. Whilst clearly a huge mistake in hindsight, we can perhaps forgive this one.\n\nLibya - She has to take part-responsibility for this. We've all the seen the \"we came, we saw, he died\" video. She was the aggressor, and she does need to take responsibility for the lack of forward planning, with, of course, Obama.\n\nHer defense of Wall Street - It is only now, in the last few years, that it has become mainstream to criticise Wall Street. People know that it was Wall Street responsible for 2008 now. Yet, in 2008, Clinton was still blaming home owners and refused to portion any blame on Wall Street.\n\nHonduras - She literally backed a fascist regime.\n\nSupported the death squads in Nicaragua in the 80s\n\nBefore the Iraq Nuclear Deal, she was always very aggressive towards Iran.\n\nShe supported the continued embargo on Cuba.\n\nShe supported No Child Left Behind.\n\nIt is on record she was one telling Bill to bomb Bosnia. Resulted in civilian deaths.\n\nSupported the PATRIOT act twice.\n\nVoted for the 2001 Bankruptcy Legislation which would have made it harder for struggling Americans to declare bankruptcy, after expressing her opposition to the bill when she was First Lady.\n\nAnd then, of course, is the controversies. The obvious ties to Wall Street. The emails. The tactics used against Sanders, and the obvious fact she was colluding with the DNC to get the nomination. \n\nAll this leaves me wondering... when on earth was she correct and on the right side of history?\n\n> *Hello, users of CMV!

            "selftext": "I was briefly semi happy to be able to vote for Gary Johnson, as I thought he followed economic consensus well, but this has been disproven to me. Johnson, Clinton, Trump, and Stein are all bad at this, and I'm not interested in discussing who is less bad. They don't need to be discussed in this thread.\n\nI am looking for a third party candidate, I don't care how obscure, who has policies who match economic consensus, as well as being at least moderately liberal on social issues and immigration. If anyone can point me to a candidate like that, I would appreciate it, as I'd prefer to actually be able to vote this year.\n\nI would hope that there is a candidate who's policy is explicitly \"I follow economic consensus where and when it exist\". Same thing with science policy. But if these candidates exist, I sure can't find them anywhere, so again, help is greatly appreciated. I will immediately provide the delta to whoever can point me in the right direction.\n\n_____\n\n> *Hello, users of CMV! This is a footnote from your moderators.
