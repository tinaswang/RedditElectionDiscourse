In pretty much any other scenario, he will.\n\nThe most recent CNN-ORC poll put Trump at 39%, a full 21% ahead of second place. He has held first place almost continuously (barring a brief peak by Ben Carson) since mid-July.\n\nPeople often say that the Republican party is split into a minority (albeit a large one) who favour Trump and a majority who are waiting for another candidate to rally behind. But at this point it's far too late for a new candidate to enter the race, and even if he did, 40% of the Republican electorate is already gone.\n\nMore importantly, looking at [this survey](http://d25d2506sfb94s.cloudfront.net/cumulus_uploads/document/lz22bazbpo/econToplines.pdf) shows that Trump beats **every single other candidate** by a significant margin in a head to head. He beats Rubio (the establishment favourite) 57 to 43 and Ted Cruz (the compromise candidate) by the same margin.\n\nHe has ridiculed women, the disabled, Mexicans and Muslims, going so far as to suggest banning the latter from entering the country. Every time, his support goes up. There is clearly nothing he can say to lose that support.\n\nAnd yet, [the betting markets](http://predictwise.com/politics/2016-president-republican-nomination/) still have Marco Rubio way out in first, and Donald Trump only in third (albeit narrowly behind Cruz), so clearly there's still some reason people think he's going to falter.

Other considerations that can be looked at is whom Trump chooses as representatives. \n\nTrumps lawyer Michael Cohen is Jewish.\n\nTrumps longtime supporter and first campaign manager Robert Stone is Jewish.\n\nTrumps political director Michael Glassner also Jewish.\n\nTrump has received numerous awards from Jewish groups. Has donated a lot of money to Israeli charities. \n\nOne can even claim that Trumps affliction for Jews started from his father, who built many assisted living houses for Jewish immigrants in NYC. \n\nAll in all I think the evidence is quite clear that Trump supports Jews.\n\nI think this evidence can also be extrapolated to mean that Trump is not a white supremacist, Nazi, racist or any other pejorative meant to indicate cultural insensitivity to those unlike him. \n\nWhether you like Trump or don't, agree with his policies or not, I would only like to discuss if you believe Trump supports the Jewish people.

            "selftext": "To clear this out of the way, I do not support Sanders or Trump, and would consider myself a slightly conservative independent. I hate Hilary and Sanders on the democrat side, so I'll likely support a Republican (likely Kasich) this cycle, although Obama was my favorite in 2008 and 2012. \n\nDonald Trump is considered a liar and hated by many, especially on Reddit, while Bernie Sanders is worshipped as the greatest thing to happen to American politics, even though I think the two are remarkably similar.\n\nBoth appeal to a specific demographic, the conservative, older white middle class for Trump and the much younger and more liberal, but also middle class whites for Sanders. The only reason Sanders has had so much success on social media and the internet is that his demographic, predominantly millennials, are much more vocal on the internet.\n\nBoth use somewhat half-truths to villainize a specific group of people and blame them for the countries problems. Trump blames mexican immigrants for unemployment and high crime statistics and muslim immigrants for terrorism, while Sanders blames 'the 1%' and 'millionaires and billionaires' for all of America's shortcomings. Both are sort of based in truth- there have been acts of terror committed by muslim immigrants, and much of the drug smuggling into the country is done by mexican immigrants, but to completely ban either group is ridiculous and massively stereotyping. For Sanders, the rich evil greedy pig bankers and wall street guys are out to screw the average joe, and we should impose all sorts of regulations to stop this from taking place. Furthermore, all rich people are lazy people who just live off capital gains from there massive investments and never work at all, but simply got lucky. Are there some very greedy wealthy people who made their fortune by screwing the middle class? Sure, but it is ridiculous to blame all rich people for being evil; furthermore, most of the wealthiest people in this country have done incredible things to get where they are today, and it is impossible to say someone like Bill Gates, Mark Zuckerberg, Jeff Bezos, all of whom have massively changed our world, don't deserve their wealth.\n\nBoth propose ridiculous solutions that will never happen, but seek to simply excite uneducated voters. Trump says he can build a wall on the border and make Mexico pay for it, an outrageous proposal. Sanders, on the other hand, has proposed all sorts of economic measures that will bankrupt our country, and simply says 'the 1%' or 'wall street' will pay for it. He wants free college, free healthcare, expanding social security, and all sorts of plans that will bankrupt our country. \n\nNeither are qualified to be president. Trump has never held political office and has a mouth that will always get him into trouble were he president. Sanders, on the other hand, has been an independent in Vermont for his entire political career, in one of the easiest states to manage for someone with his policies; Vermont is full of young, white liberals, his exact voter base, and he would not be fit to handle the full duties of the presidency. He knows little about foreign policy or the economy at large; for example, he believes interest on student loan debt should be at the same interest levels as a housing loan, even though a student loan is much riskier, because there is an actual asset that can be foreclosed upon on home loans whereas diplomas cannot sold for anything if a student cannot afford their loans. \n\nBoth are political outsiders, and their refusal to accept large donations helps them appeal to those dissatisfied with big money in politics. Trump is self-financing his campaign and is telling voters it means he cannot be bought, while Sanders use of grassroots donations make him seem more like a man of the people. Both also strongly criticize the job Washington is doing now and, although running as a republican and democrat respectively, neither seem to really get along with their party.\n\nThe two are polar opposites politically, with Sanders being very liberal and Trump very conservative, but I'm saying that their rhetoric and pandering are actually quite similar. Obviously a 21 year old drowning in college debt on Reddit while like Sanders more, whereas a 55 year old farmer in southern Texas would like Trump's message more, so CMV",

So I figured I might look into where they are coming from. Well when you gaze into the abyss it looks back.\n\nSo I find out that not only have I found xenophobia and typical right wing stuff, I find race-realism, pushes for eugenics and segregation and sometimes national socialist views. The problem is that they are alot more savvier than other conservatives who repeat the same points. Their clever enough to search for typical left wing arguments or even right wing talking points, and use it to strengthen themselves. These people are mostly trolls on twitter, but I've seen a few grow on Reddit. They seem to mostly come from American Renaissance, The Right Stuff, RadixJournal and leftovers from /pol/. Look, alot of their arguments are based on emotions and propaganda in the forms of copypastas and memes, but they still have sources to back their claims. But the thing is, I don't know how to prove these sources, statistics and theories have any weigh or not. I've come from a very different world from them and have seen a different story throughout my life, no matter how extreme. I know these people are very extreme and probably shitty people underneath, but it does raise my curiousity.\n\nSo this there some truth to this, all truth or no truth? Does race realism and human biodiversity hold water, Is ethno-nationalism really beneficial and do homogeneous societies fair better? Are stricter hierarchies and traditional gender roles the best course of action? And are whites really dying? or superior over other races for that matter?\n\nPersonally I'd like to believe that all of this is not true. I know that diversity can give birth to new ideas an open up alot of new venues, I know segregation isn't the answer from a moral standpoint and pragmatic standpoint since oppression is doomed to fail from the start and because the idea of ethnocentric nations of purity is laughable in this day and age. I also know that traditional gender roles aren't always for the best and that people can be successful without them and not have to face shame or discrimination for it, and that hierarchies is kinda impossible since even the elites depend upon others and vice versa. And I don't believe that a culture cam be superior to another since the standards used to judge other cultures come from your own, our because another culture conquered your own, so there's no real way to know. I also believe that while Intelligence has a basis in genetics, environmental and cultural factors play an underrated role that should be investigated more thoroughly, and that IQ is only one of the many forms of intelligence.\n\nSince there are barely any resources for debunking their claims I'm left to my own wits, which isn't alot. So tell me, what do you all think?\n_____\n\n> *Hello, users of CMV! This is a footnote from your moderators. We'd just like to remind you of a couple of things.

            "selftext": "So as crazy as this sounds I honestly believe Trump will become the republican nominee. So lets look at why. \n\n**1. Lets start with polling data:**\n\nAccording to Five Thirty Eight Cruz has a 52% chance of winning Iowa with Trump behind at 31%. However, if you take a look at the most recent polls added to their list, ones from Jan 13 - 19 you Trump is polling either ahead by 1% or behind by 2%. These polls were conducted either before or during the recent announcements by Sarah Palin and Terry Branstad coming out in support of Trump or against Ted Cruz (in Terry's case anyone but Cruz). This will likely cause a drop in Cruz's support in the next few days leading up to the Iowa caucus and with Trump polling ahead of Rubio (the most common third place finisher) he stands to gain the most. \n\n\n**2. Demographics of Iowa:**\n\nIn 2012 the demographics of voters in Iowa were as follows (Trump's and Cruz's numbers are in brackets afterwards). \n\n* 57% male [T: 47% male, C: 22% Female]\n\n* 58% 45+ years old [C: 18% 50+]\n\n* 52% college Degree [T: 32% without college degree]\n\n* 57% Evangelical [T: 44% non-evangelical, C: 20% Evangelical]\n\n* 99% White \n\nThese numbers show that Cruz, who overlaps well with the evangelical vote as compared to Trump, should have a strong lead over Trump. However, the close polling seems to indicate that Trump is making up ground elsewhere with voters. Determining where he is making up the ground is hard, as the two Five Thirty Eight polls listed above polled Likely Voters (LV) which usually do not count voters who have not voted in the past. Similar to Sanders' Trump will likely rally the voters without a college degree in Iowa, who are under represented in polls, and win the state.\n\n**3. Iowa's effect on NH, and current polling in NH**\n\nAccording the Five Thirty Eight Trump is the predicted winner with a 46% chance as opposed to Cruz (who has jumped from third to second) with a 15% chance. Recent polling (Jan 15-18) puts Trump up by between 7 and 20%.  NH demographics, which I wont list out here but have, in the 2008 Republican primary fit better with Trumps voting block then they do with Cruz's. \n\nIowa may have an effect on NH. According the exit polls from the 2008 primary 50% of voters decided in the last week on who to support and 22% in the last month. A win for Trump in Iowa will show that he has the support of the more conservative base while also rallying the independent vote in NH. From there winning the nomination is almost guaranteed as no candidate other then Bill Clinton has won a nomination without winning either Iowa or NH and the best establishment candidate is probably Rubio but without the support of either state it will be unlikely that he will win the nominee. \n\nSo just for the record I put the likely hood of this happening somewhere between 65-75%. The other 45-35% chance comes if Cruz wins Iowa and Rubio somehow manages to win NH then I think we have a Rubio victory.So lets CMV! \n\n\n_____\n\n> *Hello, users of CMV!

I agree with many of his policies, and believe that he is exactly the shock Washington needs to return to making progress as a society. He seems like the next FDR. However, many people believe he doesn't have the level of support necessary (I'd love to hear about the current opinion on this and see what chance he has).\n\nAssuming he fails to get the nomination, it's a certainty (literally 100%, as far as I know. I'd be interested if there is any reason this would be wrong) that Hillary is the Democratic candidate. It's looking like Trump, to the GOP's horror, will be the Republican. Obviously he's super crazy but none of the other candidates have any passionate supporters.\n\nThe obvious second choice to Bernie is Hillary. Personally I don't think she's a good choice. She seems dishonest and misleading, and changes her views too often. She also seems too connected to various businesses who exchange money with her. I also don't like a lot of her policies (death penalty, marijuana (although I don't use it and don't plan to, I think it should be an individual's choice), Middle Eastern interactions, etc). She doesn't feel like a *person*, if that makes sense. She seems like she sees herself as \"I need to uphold my contributors, who are the most important American people\", in contrast to my belief that in a democratic system (which may be un-ideal, but it's what we've got so it's what we should operate our policies in) policies should be made to benefit the largest number of people possible, regardless of those people's traits. Minorities (and I don't mean racial minorities, regardless of how often people mean that when they use the word) also need to be supported. Hillary would be unremarkable and would not distinctly alter American society.\n\nIn contrast, I believe Trump would make voters realize the absurdity of his views very quickly. He would not get a second term, and I think voter turnout would be higher because of people realizing \"Man, we messed up in 2016, let's not let that happen again\". By having an extremist like Trump, I think there would be a strong backlash toward Sanders-esque growth. Sanders' success so far would mean that a candidate with similar views would be more able to feel confident in garnering support. In essence, I think that by electing Trump, you're accepting 4 years of hell, but after those years we would get stronger, better growth for the country as a whole. Am I wrong here?\n\nCMV\n\n_____\n\n> *Hello, users of CMV! This is a footnote from your moderators. We'd just like to remind you of a couple of things.

            "selftext": "This will be long.\n\nHere is the thing- Many guys get pissed off (and in my opinion, rightfully so) at the idea that modern society as a whole teaches boys to be rapists. While there are many valid points to this I feel that it is to narrow a look on the situation- a look that ends up alienating a huge amount of people who would otherwise be open to societal reform. I intend to propose in this post that we zoom out and try to not only view Rape Culture as a whole, but try to compare it to other issues in our society.\n\nTo begin, what *is* Rape Culture? According to the internet- \"In feminist theory, rape culture is a setting in which rape is pervasive and normalized due to societal attitudes about gender and sexuality\"\n\nOk breakdown time!- Rape is seen as ok due to rampant sexisim.\n\n  But what is rape? Non consensual sex. It's someone saying their (sexual) needs trump the needs of someone else. It's about one person taking control of another person  and doing what they want because that other person doesn't matter.\n\nAnd what is sexisim? It's treating a person of the opposite gender like they are less than you *because* of their gender.\n\nSOOO- Rape Culture is a culture that teaches people it's ok to take control and power from another person because they are fundamentally different than you.\n\nSound Familiar? We can find that sentiment in *Every part* of our society- even the parts that have nothing to do with women's rights, gender rights, or even *people.* \n\nWe have a society that teaches parents and children that you have no control over your life until you are 18. That being smarter is better, stronger is better. It doesn't matter *what* you are, as long as you are better than someone. We have taught our society that it's ok to make yourself feel better by treating someone else like shit.  Can't get a girlfriend? Rape a girl and blame it on *her* sexual deviance. Can't get it up for your gf? Beat up a gay guy. Don't like your kid's career choice? Defund their college savings and spend them on yourself. Have to pick up Dog shit? Dump your animal at the pound. Got passed over for a promotion down at the precinct by a black guy? Suddenly that kid walking home looks like a \"Thug\"\n\nThese are not the statements of a Rapist (Ok, one is, but bear with me) These are the statements of an ASSHOLE.\n\nAnd when you think of it like that, everything seems to fall into place. We aren't teaching people to be rapists we are teaching them to dicks if it gets them what they want and they can get away with it.\n\nRape is most definitely a *huge* problem, and I am personally familiar with sexual assault- but anyone can tell you it's *not* about sex, it's about *power* And the fact is people hide behind all kinds of \"isims\" racisim, sexisim... You know the deal. But in the end it's just an asshole who thinks they found a way to excuse their behavior. \n\nWe need to quit alienating guys by labeling this Asshole Culture with a name that puts the blame on only their shoulders. We need to stop looking at only one battalion in an army of assholes. We'd get a hell of a lot more people on our side, instead of entire subreddits getting their britches in a twist with *you insinuating I was raised sexist makes you sexist so there* and *Men cause all the problems and therefore don't get to bitch.* It's all irrelevant because in the end nothing gets fixed. \n\nAnd, in the end blaming men and their rapey ways is the exact thing Asshole Culture has taught us to do. only see a problem that can be blamed on someone else and use it to project all of our problems upon so we don't have to deal with them. \n\nIn conclusion, Telling your daughters that they deserved their rape due to their outfit choice Is fucked up- but, in my opinion so is telling your kid people who are on the street did something to wind up there and therefore deserve it. Equally so. And more people would stand up and say something if they weren't worried about \"Sexisim\" or \"Classisim.\"\n If we just identified them ass assholes society ass a whole could ban against them and toss them out.\n\n**TLDR** Rape culture is only a portion of a larger, Asshole Culture and continuing to only focus on that is unfair to the non asshole men and only holds back the overall effort to put an end to assholery everywhere.**\n\n\n_____\n\n> *Hello, users of CMV!

            "selftext": "I would like to start by saying that I fully believe in the rights of individuals.  I live in the USA and so I'm going to frame my claim in this context because it is the system I am most familiar with.  I'm going to list several points that have personally led me to believe this to be true.  Also, I am not going to claim that any democracy at any level is a failure, but in terms of governing a large nation-state, democracy does not work.  The definition that I'm going to use for democracy in this argument is **\"a system where everyone has the right to vote\"**.\n\n1. The right to vote is a lie to the masses.  Although this is a right established by many sovereign nations for their citizens, it is purely a way to either suppress the most intelligent and adept individuals in society to go along with what the populous wants.  I don't think the republican and democratic front runners would be Trump and Clinton respectively if we didn't have to acknowledge that many idiots who will vote on one issue (people who hate immigrants, want more welfare, pro life, pro choice, etc...).  I don't believe voting should be eliminated, but I will get to that later.  When Americans turn 16 years old, all citizens aren't awarded drivers licenses - you need to prove you a competent driver and know the rules.  If you want to vote, at the age of 18 you should be required to either take some sort of test regarding how government works (because most people think the president can make laws, etc..) or meet some other requirement based on your service to the nation (like making more than $100,000 dollars or service in the military).  Having voting be an earned privilege would both galvanize people to vote if they went out of their way to receive a license and have people be educated somewhat on how the system works and policy in general.  The goal isn't to construct a system of only elite in power, it is a way to ensure that the best people are chosen to run the nation - **not people who appeal to the most citizens.**  According to [the CIA factbook](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Literacy_in_the_United_States) there is more than 97% literacy in the United States, and there wouldn't be any reason to limit such a test to people who can't understand English (I wouldn't have a problem with such a test being in Spanish or Navajo for example).  I think this is honestly something that is very reasonable and probably constitutional -  it doesn't mean people don't get to vote, it just means that people need to *earn* the right.  \n\n2.  There is no reason to think that democracy is more fair than other ways of reaching decisions.  If you were a black man living in the south during the 1960's and were alleged to have raped a white woman, 100% of the town probably wanted to lynch you.  **Just because 100% of the people want something doesn't make it right.**  I think that is something people really don't think about, there is times when we know having a purely democratic system would be a very bad idea.  Granted, the man would then be put to a jury of his peers who could be just as biased, but this is theoretically a chosen group, (not the entire population) who is voting on his outcome.  You might also be inclined to say that America is a democratic republic - which is true.  However, in a presidential election, that is a process in which the nation democratically chooses a leader (everyone's vote is equal to everyone's and everyone is allowed to participate).  Again, I know the electoral college provides somewhat of a buffer to prevent a totally democratic election, but only have a few number of times has the president with less popular votes has one the election, so I'm willing to say that the presidential election is *functionally democratic* in design.\n\n3.  Having a legislature where **BOTH HOUSES** are elected by popular votes (one based in districts and the other statewide) is destructive.  I feel like the evidence of this is fairly axiomatic.  This system leads to bloated funding because representatives and senators simply want to get reelected so they attempt to appease voters - not get results.  I actually think though that if gerrymandering was eliminated, the House should continue as designed, but the Senate needs to return to appointment.  Having Senators be subject to elections means that there is not a group in power (besides the supreme court) that is purely concerned with the best choices of government but instead getting reelected.  Essentially with the system we have, we just have 2 lower houses (that is a big claim I'm not going to defend, it is just the way I see it and I just wanted to say it).  If we want to see the government working better we need to have more people involved that aren't slaves to votes.\n\nI'll be willing to CMV if you can tell me what I said in most of my points is wrong via a convincing enough argument, or if you are able to convince me that voting is a given right to the masses.  \n\nI don't want to offer my own opinions about ideal government, that is a different discussion.\n\nI also want to note that I am open minded, or at least I think so.\n\n\n\n> *Hello, users of CMV!

            "selftext": "When I say \"money in politics\" I am specifically referring to campaign contributions. \n\nId like to start by saying I am not some deep political campaign researcher or spend vast amounts of time studying this, only what I see on the news and what I believe to be logically true. If the numbers say the opposite I will happily CMV. \n\nDonald Trump is very, very rich. Perhaps one, if not the most wealthy (net worth wise) candidate to ever be a serious contender in an election. He boasts about spending barely any raised campaign funds because he simply does not need to. He can pay out of pocket for his entire campaign including his massive Boeing jet. Since he is so rich, the average donation from a supporter does not have as great of a value to him. He is tied to no one and loyal to nobody through campaign contributions. He is able to use his own money to circumvent the system we created. Candidates like Bernie Sanders and Ted Cruz are not nearly as wealthy. They are forced to listen and appeal to a wider base of voters because their campaigns would not survive if they ignore the people. \n\nMy main view boils down to this: Donald Trump can ignore every voter and say whatever he feels because money from voters does not matter one bit to him. He can gain media attention and thus rise in polls because he has become a name brand candidate. This creates a separation or disconnect from the voters because he can, in a way, \"buy\" his own hype rather than actually having to lay out good plans for a future as President. Other candidates do not share this same disconnect because people are hesitant to donate to someone they do not truly believe will make a difference for the better. This out of touch-ness, if you will, is caused mainly by Donald Trumps wealth is a good argument for forcing candidates to use contributions rather than just their own money. CMV ",

I think he has some good ideas, and I would certainly choose him over trump.\n\nHowever he has quite a few bad and anti-intellectual ideas that aren't supported by facts or reasons. Here are a few examples of policies his supporters may love, but which aren't actually backed by sound reason or statistical data.\n\n\u2022 He is opposed to nuclear power. Even accounting for extremely rare meltdowns and waste disposal, they have less of an environmental impact than wind or solar because of the processes of constructing those energy sources, and it's orders of magnitudes more efficient.\n\n\u2022 He wants to transition to entirely renewable energy and wants to eliminate all fossil fuel including natural gas and, like I said, nuclear. This is literally completely unfeasible even at maximum theoretical efficiency with the absolutely ideal tech that we don't even have yet, we could never come close to meeting our energy needs without fossil fuels. Why then not invest in cleaner technology or natural gas or nuclear, which can realistically meet our needs while reducing our environmental impact. We should be putting our efforts towards fusion technology, which has made large strides in the last 5 years and could feasible give us all the clean energy we could ever want within the next 10-20.\n\n\u2022 While Wall Street could use some reigning in in many ways, he actively opposed the bailout. I sincerely hope I don't actually have to argue this one, as I've never read more heard of anyone with formal training in economics opposing the bailout.\n\n\u2022 He supports an assault weapons ban under the guise of saving lives. Whether for other reasons you support a ban or not, assault weapons kill laughably few people per year. In my opinion it's dishonest to push an assault weapons ban pretending it's because you want to save a significant number of lives considering how many menial things kill more people (falling down the stairs, drowning in your bathtub).\n\n\u2022 He supports a $15/h minimum wage. In theory I would too. The idea is the private sector pays workers more, they can afford a better quality of life on their own, they will be less dependent on government welfare, government saves money, good for everyone. I would support this is that was how it worked in practice. So far two cities have adopted a $15/h minimum wage, DC and San Francisco. In those two cities there has been no significant increase in the living conditions of those working minimum wage jobs, nor any decrease in dependence on government welfare. This is because these workers are asking to have fewer hours so that they can maintain their government benefits. So in the end, businesses pay more, the government pays the same, people aren't ending up with any more money, nobody is winning.\n\nThese are all stances that I'm extremely confident in because of the extensive statistical information supporting them, and/or that are overwhelmingly supported by experts in the field. Despite he plethora of knowledge against what Bernie supports, he still blindly follows these stances, and I think that's an important thing working against him.",

            "selftext": "Just a quick note before I continue - I classify myself as a Tea Party libertarian-leaning conservative. Ted Cruz's political positions overlap with mine significantly, but I refuse to back him because I believe he is malicious and slimy for the reasons I will explain. I am not an angsty teenager from /r/politics, but someone who'd be expected to rally behind Cruz.\n\nA major forefront in my argument is this video of young Ted Cruz who was asked about his aspirations. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vt-vG_TdOT4\n\nYes, I know he was 17 when he said that, and I do acknowledge that if I were to run for public office thirty years from now people can dig up some unpleasant things about me. Therefore, I won't criticize him for making a comment about wanting to be featured in a \"teen tit film\". However, I can point at what he said, and I paraphrase, \"world domination - rich, powerful, that sort of stuff\".\n\nOf course he does not mean 'world domination' in the most literal form; as he was young, his comments were intentionally hyperbolic. I would disregard the entirety of the video if this biography of young Ted Cruz had not surfaced: http://www.motherjones.com/files/ted_0.jpg\n\nHis aspirations as laid out in the biography of that image has been fairly consistent and he means what he says. Attend law school (he has), become a successful lawyer (he has), run for political offices (he has), build a solid reputation (he has), and run for President (he's doing now). This biography was written around the same time the aforementioned video was recorded. Connecting the dots, we can infer that he has prepared to run for POTUS for decades not for the betterment of the country but for himself.\n\nContrasting with other candidates,\n\n- **Bernie Sanders** spent his young adult life writing for newspapers, producing music, and supporting political causes that were heartfelt to him. He never expected to be elected mayor in Burlington, VT, and he never planned until the time was right to serve in the Senate, let alone run for President. To conclude, we can infer that Bernie is running not for himself (the dude's 74, what does he have to gain out of this?) but for the betterment of the nation because he genuinely believes that his democratic socialistic policies would alleviate the issues plaguing America today.\n- **Donald Trump** inherited and grew his wealth to unprecedented levels. He's a businessman and has been his whole life, and has nothing to gain from running for President. It is obvious that he is running because he has the arrogance of believing that he can solely save this country, and it is also obvious that he is not in this to boost his business career; his business career has not been helped when organizations suspended deals with his company due to his controversial statements.\n- **Rand Paul** is running on the platform of less fiscal spending across the board, cutting spending for the military, social programs, research and development, healthcare, and more. His main objective is to return power in the executive branch back to local governments. We know he is genuine because what he is running on is very unfriendly to just about every type of special interest. If he wanted to become President for himself and not for the betterment of America then he would be more in step with the Republican Party.\n\nI really can go on with the other candidates, but I think we all get the point.\n\nOnto my next point, Ted Cruz is lying to his base about being an outsider. He has volunteered for the George W. Bush presidential campaign, served as a lawyer his whole life, and has a wife who works for Goldman Sachs. He has every senator hating, no, **abhorring** him not because he is supposedly 'anti-establishment' but because he has an attitude impossible to work with across the board. It is easy to act obnoxious in the senate despite political differences, get hated, and blame the \"evil establishment\" and the \"Washington cartel\" when it's not them, but you.\n\nSo in the general election, despite my personal allegiances to the conservative ideology, if Ted Cruz were to win the nomination, I would think very hard and carefully about throwing my support at Ted Cruz. In fact, I would most likely abstain or vote for his opponents in the general election.\n\nBut hey, I might be wrong, naive, and drawing inconclusive lines or even making a big deal about non-issues.

            "selftext": "The largest absurdity of voting for Bernie Sanders is that he\u2019s more liberal than Obama. We all just went through two terms of having a president expected to bring about all sorts of change only to be blocked at every turn due to our bipartisan political system. Now these same Democrats think electing an even more liberal president will somehow work better within this same system - I could simply call that textbook insanity and stop here, but let\u2019s continue. \n\n\nSure, Bernie has excellent ideals and is pitching mouth-watering goals, but all verifiable observations show that it\u2019s entirely unlikely that he will accomplish any of them.\n \n>1. Bernie has managed to do little as a senator for the last 8 years (Vermont since 2007): he\u2019s sponsored 356 bills and only 3 of them have become law - that\u2019s a .84% success rate\n>>Here they are: https://www.govtrack.us/congress/bills/browse#congress=113&sponsor=400357&enacted_ex=on\n\n>2. He\u2019s terrible at working with Republicans: he\u2019s been in the bottom 10% of senators who work with the other party for his entire time in office, i.e. Republicans do not sponsor bills with him which decreases the odds of his bills getting passed\n>>Here\u2019s his latest Govtrack report card: https://www.govtrack.us/congress/members/bernard_sanders/400357/report-card/2015\n\n>3. He has poor work references: he\u2019s been endorsed by only 2 Congress members while Hillary has been endorsed by 2/3rds of Congress\n>>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Bernie_Sanders_presidential_campaign_endorsements,_2016\n>>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Hillary_Clinton_presidential_campaign_endorsements,_2016\n\n\nNow, I\u2019d be remised if I didn\u2019t touch on an important factor of these prelims. If Bernie Sanders wins it greatly increases the odds that Donald Trump, or any Republican nominee, will ultimately be the president of America and I just can\u2019t have that. For enough voters Hillary would obviously be the safer candidate if she goes against Trump, but if Bernie goes against Trump it\u2019s going to be this huge Turd Sandwich vs Giant Douche debacle in which case we practically have a coin toss. \n\n\nI\u2019m fine with having a president that gets only a little done, that can be jot down to the pros and cons of a balanced system, but if America progresses backwards I\u2019ll be fucking pissed.\n\nI don\u2019t want to make this any longer, but Hillary will get more - of the right things - done. \n\n>1. She\u2019s known for being able to work with both parties and has more national level successes under her belt\n>>http://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2015/09/carly-fiorina-debate-hillary-clintons-greatest-accomplishment-213157\n>>https://www.hillaryclinton.com/feed/seven-hillary-clintons-biggest-accomplishments/\n\n>2. For the most part, Hillary shares the same views as Bernie\n>>http://presidential-candidates.insidegov.com/compare/35-40/Bernie-Sanders-vs-Hillary-Clinton\n>>http://www.businessinsider.com/hillary-clinton-vs-bernie-sanders-on-the-issues-2015-9\n\n>3. And while Hillary having Bill Clinton on her side is unfair to consider, in a way, it would only be a benefit to America and that\u2019s what this is all about. \n\nPlease vote for Hillary in the upcoming prelims. We need a president willing to compromise in a liberal direction, not an idealist who the majority of congress won't work with.",

            "selftext": "I keep seeing arguments that money in politics is a problem. Unless it's used to orchestrate voter fraud, it's not a problem. \n\nWhy is it not a problem: Sanders fans, why are there so many people cheering for Trump, Rubio, and Cruz?  How do these people get elected?  The people with billionaire backing....votes. Those I. The crowd vote. They're not given money to vote. They listen to the message and vote of their own free will. \n\nThe people still retain the right to vote. So the problem lies with the cognitive ability of voters.\n\nSanders fans: does the possibility exist that Sander's plans are bunk?  If implemented would breaking up banks work or free college work? Do you have a bias when it comes to Sanders? How many college kids voted because they understood the issues?\n\nDid people vote for Obama because he was black?  Are you people?\n\nhttp://mobile.nytimes.com/2013/11/03/opinion/sunday/health-beauty-and-the-ballot.html?referer=&_r=0\n\nWhat does the above have to do with money?\n\nNow, you may say money stifles variety of candidates. Sanders sort of disproves this with his per capita donation. O'Malley has a PAC. While message is a factor, money isn't the issue in this case. \n\nAlright, the above is my thoughts on elections. What about quid pro quo while they are in office?\n\nOkay. \n\nFirst, can you establish that money changes candidate message?  That a candidate sees a mountain of cash and says, eh okay...oil. If you can see an evolution of view, can you tease out experience?  Perhaps Obama wasn't for Guantanamo but then, as President, saw the necessity. \n\nNow we're back to candidate selection. \n\nPAC commercials. How can we restrict political speech? I just watched the second episode of X-Files and sure enough, Ford product placement. Scully using the features in her Ford. How can you keep a scripted character from voicing political opinion?  Have a character who is losing their job and suffering because a solar company is crowding out his fracking job. \n\nWhat logistical plan do you have for taking political messages out of media?  Does Twitter, Reddit, and YouTube count?  There are opposing viewpoints in this sub. \n\nMillennials have YouTube. Messages go viral. YouTube is free. So in a decade or two, political messages can spread for free. They can spread now. And those born in 1997-98 can vote, there's no reason to not use YouTube, have messages go viral, and affect politics. \n\nThe problem is no one wants to take the reigns and run. They just want to complain and blame a red herring - money in politics.    \n",

            "selftext": "I could probably point out other perfectly valid arguments for not supporting Hillary Clinton's candidacy, but I'd be lying if I said I ever took her seriously following her support of the Iraq War. I base my opinion on three points:\n\n**IT'S INCREDIBLY CONSEQUENTIAL**\n\nThe war's tangible toll includes: [4491 US Troops, 318 Other Troops, 1554 Contractors] killed (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iraq_War), 117,961 total wounded,  [In excess of 500,000 total killed (mostly civilians)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Casualties_of_the_Iraq_War), [$2.2 Trillion direct and as much as $6 Trillion spent just in the US](http://www.reuters.com/article/us-iraq-war-anniversary-idUSBRE92D0PG20130314). The war also de-stabilized the region, and can be seen as the primary cause of the subsequent unrest including the [Syrian Civil War](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syrian_Civil_War) and the rise of [ISIS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Islamic_State_of_Iraq_and_the_Levant).\n\nThe intangible costs of the war run much deeper. They can be seen in the lack of US support for ground presence in Syria, the approximately 6500 veteran suicides per year, even the rise of reactionary Nationalist movements in the US and Europe coinciding with the [European Migrant Crisis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_migrant_crisis) and the increasing financial strains on the federal government. Quite simply, the Iraq War is the single most consequential political decision in more than a generation. **But even worse, it was a binary decision** - it could quite conceivably never have happened. The difference between major political views on most issues are on a sliding scale: high tax rate vs. a lower one, more health care coverage vs. less and so on. All of the tangible consequences of the war and many of the intangible ones hinge solely on the decision to invade.\n\n**IT'S UTTERLY INDEFENSIBLE**\n\nIn recent years, Hillary Clinton, her supporters and unrelated others have engaged in [historic revisionism](http://www.dailykos.com/story/2016/2/4/1480069/-Enough-of-the-Iraq-War-Revisionism-Hillary-Voted-for-War) with regards to the Iraq vote. I can only address some of their claims here: Most Democrats did not support the war: A majority of Democratic congressmen [voted AGAINST the war](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iraq_Resolution#United_States_House_of_Representatives). At the time of her Iraq vote [a majority of both Democrats and Liberals](http://www.gallup.com/poll/7699/blacks-postgraduates-among-groups-most-likely-oppose-iraq-invasion.aspx) opposed the Iraq war. In fact, at the time of the Iraq vote (October 2002), [a plurality of ALL Americans](http://usatoday30.usatoday.com/news/poll1007.htm) did not support an Iraq war, did not feel that the US had done enough to prevent it and felt that Congress should have the final say on whether the US should invade or not - a responsibility the Iraq War vote explicitly abdicated. A report by chief UN weapons inspector Hans Blix declared there was [no evidence](http://www.cnn.com/2003/US/03/07/sprj.irq.un.transcript.blix/) that Saddam Hussein had either restarted his chemical/biological weapons program or possessed WMDs. Iraq, for its part [welcomed](http://www.un.org/apps/news/story.asp?NewsID=6383) increased inspection in the lead-up to the war but these inspectors were [recalled immediately prior to the bombings](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations_Monitoring,_Verification_and_Inspection_Commission). Hillary Clinton also voted against the [Levin Amendment](http://www.nytimes.com/2007/03/01/opinion/01chafee.html?_r=1) and [Durbin Amendment](http://www.senate.gov/legislative/LIS/roll_call_lists/roll_call_vote_cfm.cfm?congress=107&session=2&vote=00236) which would've limited Bush's War authority to the UN-related and Immediate national security related concerns Clinton's supporters now claim her vote was about.  In short, the Iraq war occured without any conclusive evidence to justify it and with majority opposition from Hillary Clinton's ideological peers. The fact the run up to the war, including evidence of WMDs was explicitly split on ideological lines should say more than enough about where Hillary Clinton stood in her Iraq policy.\n\nBy [mid-2003](http://www.un.org/press/en/2003/sc7777.doc.htm), it was clear to the UN that there was no evidence of WMDs in Iraq. It was despite this lack of evidence then, that Clinton [argued for an ESCALATION of the Iraq War](http://www.nytimes.com/2005/07/13/nyregion/the-evolution-of-hillary-clinton.html) long after its WMD/National Security rationale had been debunked. This could only be interpreted as an explicit endorsement of nation-building with the US Military. In summary, contemporaneous evidence clearly contradicts Hillary Clinton's rationale for her Iraq vote, and the fact that she's making excuses at all implies that it was far more than simply an accident or mistake.\n\n**IT'S STILL RELEVANT TODAY**\n\nEven besides its continuing consequences, the Iraq vote provides representative insight into Hillary Clinton's foreign policy. She has continued her support of regime change in Libya and Syria, and her support of a No-Fly-Zone puts her in a more hawkish position than most Democrats (including Bernie Sanders and Barack Obama) and many prominent Republicans (Donald Trump, Ted Cruz, Rand Paul). Her initial approval for [ground troops](http://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2015/nov/19/hillary-clinton-isis-strategy-ground-troops-airstrikes-no-fly-zone-syria) in Syria put her in a more hawkish position than even most Republicans before she [walked it back](http://www.ibtimes.com/hillary-clinton-flip-flopping-ground-troops-fight-isis-us-sends-troops-iraq-clinton-2206261). Her defense of the vote extended well into her first Presidential Campaign, long past the time other political opportunists walked away from their decisions, and the historical revisionism I discussed in the previous section arguably represents a defense not just of her vote but of a real philosophy behind the vote. Of the major 2016 candidates, and certainly all of the libertarian/progressive ones, Hillary Clinton is unquestionably among the most likely to put the US in a future Iraq-like quagmire in Iraq, Syria, Iran or somewhere unforeseen. Given the immense consequences of such an outcome as outlined in the first section, Hillary Clinton's support of Iraq and continued hawkishness outweigh any potentially-redeeming quality make her candidacy for Commander-in-Chief a non-starter to anyone uninterested in repeating the mistakes of Iraq.\n_____\n\n> *Hello, users of CMV!

As it has typically been in the past, I agree with some things from each candidate, and disagree on other things (some more than others). \n\nAt the moment I have a very jaded view of our (U.S.) political system. It doesn't work the way we were taught in school - not by a long shot. The truth of the matter is that there are many, many men and women in power who are making decisions for their own best interest, and only a few who are really considering the people's wishes or the best interest of our country. The president, while still powerful, is only as powerful as this group allows him/her to be. Essentially, I believe that this country is being entirely run by an \"in\" crowd of politicians who understand how to push votes in a direction to accomplish their agenda. Sometimes their agendas conflict; sometimes they don't. \n\nThat being said I believe that anyone who falls very far outside the \"in\" crowd in terms of their beliefs or approach does not stand a chance at making real change from the position of the White House. I believe they will be stone walled from *both* sides as I believe something both sides can agree on is that they don't want someone to rip apart the sweet system they've built for themselves over decades. As such, I feel the best candidate for the White House is someone who is with the \"in\" crowd, does not have extreme ideas, and but yet understands just well enough how to manipulate that crowd in order to effect some change. \n\nIn other words, I believe that a candidate with such out-of-the-box ideas as Bernie Sanders or Donald Trump will not actually be able to accomplish anything in the White House, even if elected into the position. Our time will simply be wasted for the next 4 years if not worse. Instead, I believe *some* change will come about if we have a candidate that understands how to play the game and can make incremental change that trends in the direction we (I) want this country to go. \n\n_____\n\n> *Hello, users of CMV!

            "selftext": "Oh gosh where to start. Lets go with Thesis: American politicking and campaigning is to elect a King, not a President of an Executive. \n\nWhy is this my view?\n\nJust look at the front runners of the Democrats and Republicans: Trump and Bernie. Lets start with everyone favorite, Bernie. Lines of argument are usually revolving around a very Obama 2008 style of rhetoric: Hope and Change, but to Bernie's credit, he actually has platforms that he supports with real studies and bills attached to them. Cool. However, what he, and all his supporters dont seem to realize is that if he is elected president, the number of legislators who will be able to actually introduce and vote on passing said legislation because they are out of the closet socialists in congress will be 0. 0. Zilch. Nada. Will some democrats latch on to his ideas? Sure. Of course! But will 60% of the senate and 50% of congress? Nope. Not a chance. So how are Bernie and Company going to pass a single page of the agenda? Through executive orders? If that happens, then the legislature would be obsolete and the Presidency would be that in name only. We would have a king. \n\nSimilarly, Trumpies/Cruzites are equally as deluded about their ability to do the things they promise. Build a wall? Register the Muslims? Stop refugees? How? How can they do any of that unless they use executive power to simply override the congress? This seems rather silly. BUt here is the thing.\n\n Every American takes a civics course in High School. Everyone knows about the 3(4 really though) Branches of government, checks and balances, etc. But everyone ignores that. We ask candidates how they intend to rule the country as if they were legislating. It is absolutely comedic and stupid. \n\nOn Foreign Policy, most of the promises are empty, as we saw Obama prove. You dont know what you cant know and if youre not Commander in Chief, you are not allowed access to the most secret documents in the world! You cant actually credibly promise action without knowing all the details. And surprise, surprise, nothing changes when a new President gets into office. Every President since FDR has been interventionist in some respect. Every single one. That is no accident. We even ask them questions like \"how are you going to stop ISIS\" as if they, with no clearance or qualifications, could accurately outline a plan to stop an international terrorist organization. \n\nAmerican politics is theater and not very good one because candidates are asked to and want to be kings, not presidents. \n\nMy conclusion: The executive has too much power in this country. The executive should not be the regulator because it gives the executive too much power and it is starting to show through the last 20 years of overreaching executive orders (but thats a separate CMV) \n\nEdit: Im being downvoted for every reply I make. I will not participate any more due to this. Clearly I am in the wrong sub apparently. \n_____\n\n> *Hello, users of CMV! This is a footnote from your moderators.

Instead, he almost invariably falls back upon yelling about how great he'll do, how great America will be, and how he'll do unrealistic/illegal things as president (build a wall, have Mexico pay for said wall, spy on all mosques, prevent Muslims from entering the country, revoke birthright citizenship, etc.).\n\nWhen asked a direct question, he will avoid the subject, repeat the question, acknowledge the problem, and/or assert that he will fix whatever the problem is, without ever giving details of how he intends to get his plans enacted.\n\nBasically, Trump has no substance as a candidate. So many people seem to support him that I'm hopeful that I'm overlooking some great quality of his, or have missed his meaningful answers to policy questions. Otherwise the situation is depressing. Please CMV.\n\nEDIT: There's also a lot of misconceptions around his candidacy, like the idea that he'd be a good president because he's run large, profitable companies, depite the fact that the US government is not a company, should not be run like one, and the position of president is very different from the of a CEO or president of a large company.\n\n_____\n\n> *Hello, users of CMV!

To me, the whole thing is unbearably undemocratic, and while I do believe that a Hillary presidency would be better (if only marginally) than a Cruz or Trump presidency, I feel like validating the cronyism of the political system will only allow this sort of undemocratic behavior to continue unchecked.\n\nI feel like all we can do is send the message that our votes aren't guaranteed, and that the party must win them every election with a solid platform and transparent process, not a vapid coronation of an heir-apparent candidate.\n\nEDIT:\n\nTo reiterate: My decision has nothing to do with Hillary.  It's about the apparent decision of the DNC to deprive voters fair access to the democratic process by scheduling only 6 debates on off hours (down from 26 last time), the decision of Media outlets like CNN to let their financial contributions to her campaign seemingly affect their coverage, and the decision of state Democratic officials like in Iowa to fudge and obfuscate the process.  A vote against Hillary is, in my view, a vote against seeming party cronysim and the sense that a candidate may be an heir-apparent, needing no challenger and meriting no debate.",

I believe Trump does this on purpose because he's a master salesman and a salesman's only agenda is to CLOSE THE DEAL. Trump is simply trying to close the deal on his candidacy at any cost because once he's elected office it's too late, he's president now. No wall, no economic reform nothing. And Trump knows this. This is why he's a conman. \n\nHis supporters are gullible for believing his absurd statements or they are willfully ignorant because they think at the very least, he'll enact some sort of white nationalistic agenda. \n\nThey could have voted Rand Paul but they didn't for some reason so I don't believe trump support is due to lack of options. \n\n\n\n_____\n\n> *Hello, users of CMV!

We live in an era where a vast majority of people who browse the internet are using an adblocker, a script blocker, or anything in between--myself included. I know the general excuse for this sort of thing is \"invasive advertisements\" and sometimes even \"popups\" (even though every internet browser comes with an in-built popup blocker) but that's not good enough for me. You, me, and everyone who browses the internet is actively shutting down means by which companies can put their product across, and that seems like an extreme answer to an occasional troublesome advertisement here or there.\n\nThere's this thing in evolutionary biology that's normally referred to as the \"Evolutionary Arms Race\": it's when a predator and a prey species are constantly and cohesively evolving traits that make them both constantly neck and neck. I bring this up because people seem to think that it's the way things work when it comes to advertiser/consumer relations. It doesn't. The relationship between advertiser and consumer is nothing like that. As a matter of fact, we're reliant on advertisements as much as advertisers rely on us. There's a certain level of interaction that's expected if we as consumers are to survive, and if they as companies are to maintain their existence.\n\nI'm going to put aside my hatred for the likes of /r/hailcorporate for this post, but I'm also going to say that I won't accept the hc paranoid mentality or its idiotic answers. I want a real answer. I want someone to tell me why stealth marketing is damaging to the economy, not that it's some sort of ethical dilemma, because we've already broken the ethical code by throwing advertisers out the window. I don't want answers telling me about how \"the man is evil\" or how Big Brother wants to control our wallets, I want an answer that will actually make me think about the economic situation and *not* answers that will make me want to choke you for being a bellend.\n\n**TL;DR** sure big companies are greedy, but we, as individuals, have managed to trump that greediness by not only  over-using adblockers, but also by creating things like /r/hailcorporate to bitch about the things that marketers have to use to get by our over-use of adblock. We deserve to be deceived. CMV.\n\ne: obligatory grammar fixing edit\n\ne2: I'd also like to point out that I also don't see stealth marketing as a big deal at all, and something that is far less severe than pop-ups and noisy sidebar ads. And, of course, I still think we deserve it.",

However, Sanders stump speech that he repeats ad nauseam give me the feeling he's talking down to us voters, similarly to how trump talks. \nFor example, his proposed tax on \"speculative trading\" sounds ridiculous on its face to me. Now no one wants to pay more for consumer goods because there's a bubble in the cost of their futures' contracts, but this solution just seems ham-handed and naive. I've taken some economics and finance classes (and forgot neraly everything from them lol), but this reminds me of some articles we read in one or the other about how governments would try to outlaw short-selling, to protect the domestic economy. Surely investors will find a way. And surely raising money for speculative projects is the beauty of the stock market.       \nFinally, for all his nearly-conspiratorial accusations against money-in-politics, I'm still not convinced the effects of these are anywhere near as pernicious as he and his supporters will tell you. I also don't know if I've heard a solution from him. Overturning Citizens' United is one thing (and this is besides the point, but I don't see how super-pac ads don't qualify as freedom of speech), but even if you do, how is the power vacuum going to be filled?    \n           As you may have noticed, I'm kind of a naive college kid, I don't like that Clinton is such a hawk, and I don't like any of the republicans, so maybe he's my favorite candidate. My positions certainly aren't well-formed, but I'm always willing to change my mind.           \nSo if you want some easy deltas, go for it.",

            "selftext": "Mike Bloomberg, former mayor of New York City and founder and head of the data and media company that shares his name, has apparently once again [publicly floated the idea of an independent presidential run](http://www.nytimes.com/2016/01/24/nyregion/bloomberg-sensing-an-opening-revisits-a-potential-white-house-run.html) this fall.\n\nHe would effectively only run if the race were Trump/Cruz against Sanders, on the rationale that there would be room to run in the middle of two extreme and controversial candidates. And he has plenty of money to fund a campaign (he said he would spend a billion dollars on a run).  However, I think in practical reality this is not a winning strategy.\n\nFirst there are the huge obstacles that any third part or independent candidate for president must face.  There are a certain number of voters who will pretty much stick to the party ticket.  They lack the massive organization that the political parties bring.\n\nThe electoral college is part of this inherent obstacle.  The nation is highly geographically heterogeneous, and even if it averages out to being centrist, most states lean strongly one way or another.  A lot of liberal and conservative states would be out of play basically from the beginning.\n\nThird, as a candidate he is not particularly inspiring.  He's more of a policy wonk than anything, and he's not a particularly good speaker. He's unlikely to inspire passion and excitement the way Trump, Cruz and Sanders can.\n\nFourth (and arguably the clincher) is that even if he were running as a centrist pragmatist, he'd actually be very controversial in many arenas.  For example, his support for abortion rights, strong advocacy for gun control, and \"nanny state\" public health policies (like the indoor smoking ban and size restrictions on sodas) will turn many conservative voters against him, and his Wall Street ties, clashes with unions, prior support for the war in Iraq, and association with stop-and-frisk  will turn many liberals against him.  He may average out to being a moderate, but he has some pretty controversial views on both ends of the political spectrum that will disqualify him in the eyes of many voters.\n\nSo, change my view.  Why does Bloomberg have any real chance of winning?\n\n_____\n\n> *Hello, users of CMV! This is a footnote from your moderators. We'd just like to remind you of a couple of things.

And I'm talking primarily about the way the term is used in the context of American politics.\n\nFirst, the phrase exists primarily as a way of putting a negative spin on what's usually just basic decency.  We can all think of plenty of contexts where being \"anti-PC\" is just a euphemism for thinly veiled racism or sexism. But in a broader sense, it's a way to pass off crude generalizations as straight talk or brutal honestly.\n\nSecond, the way we conceptualize political correctness has a clear conservative bias. By that I mean that as a country we don't conceptualize it as political correctness when speech and other forms of free expression are expected to pander to conservative sensibilities.\n\nThe result is that someone like Donald Trump can claim to be politically incorrect in a self-congratulatory way, be praised for it by his supporters, while pandering equally hard to a different side of the political spectrum and using the language and framing that won't offend them. He knows which narratives to affirm to give the impression of telling it like it is.\n\nClearly a lot of people take this term seriously, so what am I missing? Is it a valid concept that's simply being misused? Have I mischaracterized it altogether? Is there an upside to this term that I'm not seeing where it actually contributes in a positive way to political discussion?\n_____\n\n> *Hello, users of CMV! This is a footnote from your moderators.

            "selftext": "**TL;DR: The revolution Bernie is relying on to achieve change isn't going to work out especially under a Republican Congress, so a Bernie presidency = no change. Hillary can achieve incremental change, which is better than no change.**\n\nWe're facing the choice of sticking with the safer choice or going for broke with the revolutionist. Bernie's chances of success are completely dependent on [a revolution led by ordinary people](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8jV4sv9waB0&t=5m28s), and I'm sad to say I don't think this revolution is going to work.\n\n**Bernie supporters: please don't just downvote me. I will change my vote if you can change my view.**\n\nI've been disillusioned by the lack of progress Democrats have made. It was a huge disappointment that Clinton didn't lead us to universal healthcare in the 90s, a time when *everyone* was in agreement that we were overdue for an overhaul of the system, to the point that even Republicans were coming up with plans for universal healthcare, albeit weak ones that probably wouldn't have worked. And yet Republicans killed the momentum, associating universal healthcare with socialism and popularizing the idea that \"there's gotta be a better way,\" sure everyone wants to fix the problem but no one can agree on how to do it, so nothing happens.\n\nAt the time, I was frustrated with Hillary. I thought she was compromising with conservatives too much and conservatives were never going to cooperate. I thought, there are all these plans out there; we should just go with one of them already because any of them would be better than what we have now, and things are getting worse. I thought, we just need to convince people that the moral thing to do is to treat healthcare as a right. And that's what Bernie is doing--I think I would be all for Bernie ten years ago, but I'm even more disillusioned now. I was moved [when Hillary said,](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/post-politics/wp/2015/08/18/clinton-tells-black-lives-matter-activists-to-focus-on-ways-to-change-policy-not-change-hearts/)\n\n> I don't believe you change hearts. I believe you change laws, you change allocation of resources, you change the way systems operate. You're not going to change every heart. You\u2019re not. But at the end of the day, we could do a whole lot to change some hearts and change some systems and create more opportunities for people who deserve to have them, to live up to their own God-given potential, to live safely without fear of violence in their own communities, to have a decent school, to have a decent house, to have a decent future. So we can do it one of many ways. You can keep the movement going, which you have started, and through it you may actually change some hearts. But if that's all that happens, we'll be back here in 10 years having the same conversation. We will not have all of the changes that you deserve to see happen in your lifetime because of your willingness to get out there and talk about this.\n\nAnd I'm starting to believe she's right, as uninspiring as that sounds. I'm thinking Bernie can do more good if he keeps preaching and changing some hearts outside of \"the establishment\", and we need a more pragmatic negotiator on the inside.\n\nObama's failure to achieve what we hoped he could made me think even more that we need a pragmatic approach. I think it's very telling that [Obama said Hillary was right and ultimately signed the ACA, which resembled the plan Hillary had been pushing for all along much more than than his.](http://www.nationalaffairs.com/publications/detail/the-clintonian-roots-of-obamacare) Hillary learned from experience and she knows what works and what doesn't.\nBut I actually feel inspired now by [the audacity of political realism,](http://www.vox.com/2016/1/28/10858464/hillary-clinton-bernie-sanders-political-realism) because you know what? We are much better off now with the ACA. I for one sure have benefited. The ACA isn't perfect but it was a huge accomplishment, really the only progress we've seen in universal healthcare going back to Truman, and we have the opportunity to build on the ACA and help more people. And the person who can be the best successor to Obama is Hillary, as [Obama himself seems to suggest.](http://www.politico.com/story/2016/01/obama-iowa-2016-sanders-off-message-218166)\n\nWhen I bring this up with Bernie supporters they've argued that Bernie can negotiate too, he's worked across the aisle before. But what has Bernie accomplished doing that? He's brought up veteran legislation, but he was also very unhappy with what little came from that. Hillary got S-CHIP, foster care reform (working with Tom DeLay of all people!), certainly deserves played a major role in getting the ACA passed, and more. Bernie [exaggerated his role in writing the ACA and only begrudgingly voted for it.](http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2016/jan/18/bernie-s/fact-checking-bernie-sanders-claim-he-helped-write/) I was also concerned about Bernie's negotiation skills when he argued for meeting with our enemies without conditions in the most recent debate. Bernie may ultimately compromise on his plans which most pundits and calling wildly unrealistic, but I feel better going for the candidate who is most likely going to be better at negotiating, who has already fought hard for healthcare reform and learned important lessons from that, lessons I don't want to wait for Bernie to learn in office. Hillary also has more clout in the Democratic party which I think is critical for getting things done.\n\nWhat Bernie has in his favor is that he realizes, in ways Obama didn't, that he can't inspire a Republican Congress to get on board by himself. He says that it's critical that we have a revolution led by ordinary people. But is that going to work? I'm not optimistic. Social media makes it look like Bernie is gaining awesome momentum, but looking at polls (and looking at how popular Trump is turning out to be, I'm deeply concerned) I don't think he's got enough people. [And voter turnout is shaping up to be lower than in 2008](http://m.huffpost.com/us/entry/voter-turnout_n_2088810.html) so it looks to me that Bernie isn't inspiring as many people as Obama did, and we know how that turned out. And if people can't even get out and vote, what are the chances they're going to keep up the revolution after the election? And if they do, what can they even do, realistically? Most likely even less people are going to turn up for critical midterms. Bernie's supporters can hold petitions and protests, but I hate to say this, when's the last time those things made a significant impact? How well have Occupy Wall Street and Black Lives Matter turned out? On the flip side, Hillary has been vigorously attacked for decades and she's still standing strong, and I can't imagine what else her opponents could throw at her. I don't think Bernie will fare as well, and Republicans have yet to attack him ([some have even bolstered his campaign,](http://www.bloomberg.com/politics/articles/2016-01-19/republican-operatives-are-trying-to-help-bernie-sanders) possibly because they see him easier to beat).\n\nMoreover, if Bernie wins, we could be looking at a Republican counterrevolution that could set us back from making any progress, similar how the 90s healthcare reform fizzled out. On the flip side, Hillary has been vigorously attacked for decades, arguably more than any other political figure, and she's still standing strong, so I think she would fare better.\n\nBernie's great, but the president doesn't have that much power anyway. I'd like him to continue doing good work in the Senate, where he can vote and introduce legislation, which he can't do as President. But the President is in a unique position to convince Congress members to change their votes, and I think Hillary would be better that. Bernie would be a good partner in the Senate; Hillary would have less of an impact there than she would as President.\n\nI also have other concerns about Bernie, such as his lack of knowledge on foreign policy and lack of advisors (a 2002 vote is not a plan to defeat ISIS), his class-first approach to disparities and how he's responding to minority activists, and I think even if by some miracle he gets his health reform passed (he can't), it's not the right way to go--I favor getting a handle on costs first and then moving towards single payer down the line, which is going to take more than 8 years. But, my main hangup is I don't see Bernie being effective as a president. So, if you can convince me Bernie's revolution is going to work and he will achieve change, I'll change my view.",

            "selftext": "Donald Trump is dismantling the GOP as we know it one Bible-thumping conservative at a time.  He blamed Bush for 9/11.  He condemned the Iraq War before AND after it. He's called the Pope Pathetic.  He's come out in support of Planned Parenthood (in terms of women's health issues).  All things that are very un-republican.  Finally, he doesn't rely on ANYONE's opinion to fund his campaign.  Not corporations or ours frankly.   Trump is anti-establishment. \n\nBernie Sanders is not anti-establishment. \n\nLet me just first begin by pointing out that [Bernie Sanders got elected with the help of the NRA](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/how-the-nra-helped-put-bernie-sanders-in-congress/2015/07/19/ed1be26c-2bfe-11e5-bd33-395c05608059_story.html). So right off the bat, the Bern was in the pocket of the gun lobbyists.  Sounds pretty establishment to me.    \n\nSecondly, Bernie Sanders is not shaking up the left like Trump is shaking up the right.  He's a Liberal.   Yes, he's slightly more to the left than Hillary but at the end of the day, he voted with her [93% of the time in the Senate](http://www.nytimes.com/2015/05/28/upshot/the-senate-votes-that-divided-hillary-clinton-and-bernie-sanders.html?_r=0).   Calling out the billionaires and crooked bankers is nothing new but it just looks really profound when you compare him to Hillary who might be the most corrupt politician of our time.  Not many Democrats disagree that we should raise the taxes on the super rich, not even Hilary who is in bed with the super rich.  \n\nSo I guess I should define what anti-establishment means in this election.   An anti-establishment candidate is a game changer (for better or worse).  Someone who is actually changing the paradigm of American politics.   Not accepting large donations or money from Super Pacs is a start.

            "selftext": "This is not a debate over the merits of their individual policies or platforms. I am also not going to be persuaded by any polls that are out now, as the hypothetical matchup polls this early on in the process tend to favor candidates with the most name recognition. I am also not arguing that a Kasich-Rubio ticket *would* defeat Clinton or Sanders, just that they would be the most likely to out of the current lot of Republican candidates. To change my view you would need to tell me which Republican ticket would fare better than Kasich-Rubio and why. \n\nSo here's why I think they stand the best chance:\n\n1) Ohio and Florida. Kasich has [a very high approval rating](http://www.politico.com/story/2015/10/poll-john-kasich-ohio-approval-numbers-214549) in Ohio as does [Rubio in Florida](http://www.tampabay.com/blogs/the-buzz-florida-politics/rubio-gets-highest-job-approval-rating-in-new-florida-poll/2242705). Obviously, Ohio and Florida are the two biggest battleground states, and if the Republicans were able to carry both of them that would seriously tilt the odds in their favor. \n\n2) Governors have an edge. Since Carter, four out of six presidents were former governors. That's good for Kasich, who will be able to dodge any questions about his experience or qualifications. \n\n3) The VP generally needs to be a senator, or otherwise a long tenure as a representative. Marco Rubio fits that bill. \n\n4) Both of them are the most moderate in the pack of Republican candidates (insane rhetoric they're required to throw around during the primary cycle notwithstanding). They have the greatest appeal to independents and moderate voters.\n\n5) If Hillary Clinton nominates Julian Castro, who's considered by many to be her most likely VP pick, Marco Rubio would have a serious advantage over him when it comes to experience, especially since they are both young and hispanic and have comparable backgrounds. \n\n6) Jeb Bush has too much family baggage to win the primary, much less the general. Cruz is insane and would be destroyed in the general. And there's no way Trump could win in the general, barring some insane October surprise that completely derailed Clinton's chances (though I do think Trump would probably win over Sanders).  ",

            "selftext": "This will be the first presidential election that I can vote in. My age bracket has the lowest voting turnout, so to not contribute a vote feels bad. However, unlike my peers, I have no strong reservations with either party/candidate. Partly this has to do with my disinterest with the whole race in general, but also because the only reasonable diverse discussion to be found regarding politics can be found online and even that is dubious and probably left-orientated. \n\nI have heard absolutely egregious things about Trump, so never planned to vote for him. However I know absolutely nothing about the other Republican candidates (except for some of their names). As well, I have heard that most candidates go very far left/right in the primaries to pander to the small extreme minority that actually votes then (not sure how true this is, have no sources), so even then I'm not sure how much what Trump says is playing to that strategy or what he genuinely believes.\n\nI have a slightly better idea of the Democratic candidates, but that's due to my peers who may or may not have sufficient information to go off of (I cannot be the judge if their information is correct, as I have no knowledge of the other side and only a tenuous connection to the Democratic party as I grew up neutral in a Red state). Bernie seems like the stronger choice since his views on privacy align mostly with mine, but I have heard very poor things about his economic policies both on Reddit and in the news. I have also heard fears that if he was chosen in the primaries, then he would be too left for the majority of voters so the Republicans might win have they have a more centrist candidate. Hillary has been put forward as a alternative, but the only thing I have heard of her of how horrible she is for some reason and all the emails she had hacked out of her email account. \n\nSo that's literally the extent of all my political knowledge gathered from article titles in /r/worldnews and headlines in the actual news. That was just give you my simple background, again I am **not** looking to be swayed to vote a particular side, I want to be convinced to vote in general. \n\nBased off my very limited knowledge of both parties, I do not feel like I should vote. While inaction is not a very appealing option, I do not want to make the wrong choice, and it in fact would be very difficult to understand if I made the wrong choice (because if the candidate lost, I'd never know of his/her actual effectiveness as a world leader, and if they win I'm sure the media will just complain about them to no end like most presidential candidates in the last several several years) so I could not adequately judge my actions. Now one vote probably won't make a huge difference, but I am more worried of the precedent it would set in my mind: voting with the Democrats would just be following my peers blindly, and voting Republican would just seem like a rebellious choice since I'm even less informed about them than the Democrats. I'm thinking it instead would be better to not make an uninformed decision this time and instead wait and gather information in the coming years to vote for a correctly for a congressional seat and ultimately the POTUS.\n\nPlease change my view so I can feel sure that going into the voting booth this year is the right choice!",

            "selftext": "VIEW CHANGED EDIT: It seems there are definitely situations in which relying on someone to say \"No\" if they don't want sex is not a safe option; people, especially women, can be intimidated to the point of fearing physical violence. This could happen even if the other person involved has not purposefully tried to seem intimidating, so it's just safer if everyone asks for consent. Also, there are several ways of asking for verbal consent without being direct or mood-killing.\n\n\nThe \"Yes means Yes\" standard is an emerging standard for gaining sexual consent, in response to cases of rape and sexual assault, in which it is sometimes seen that the aggressor was unaware that the victim did not want to have sex, as the victim did not verbally object. With \"Yes means Yes\", initiators of sex need to get each other's verbal consent (A \"Yes\" or some type of affirmation) before having sex, to avoid these cases.\n\n**Why not just say \"No\"?**\n\nI don't like the sound of it, for a few reasons. First, let me establish that, when talking about this, I feel the need to distinguish between rapes where the aggressor is aware that the victim does not want sex (or whatever sexual act), and those where they are not. If the aggressor knows they are raping someone, then obviously saying \"No\" or \"Yes\" is completely irrelevant, and so falls outside of the scope of the \"Yes meets Yes\" standard. Instead, the standard addresses cases where the aggressor would stop if the victim actually objected, but is unaware of the victim's unwillingness because the victim does not object. I've been talking to some friends about this, and they've explained that an example of the \"Yes means Yes\" standard being useful is if a person, say a woman, is too intimidated by the man who wants to have sex with them to object. If the man at any point asks for affirmation, and is then met with a 'no', the case of sexual assault is avoided. They claim this is a common, or at least very feasible, occurrence.\n\nBut this example really doesn't work for me, because if a person is raping on purpose, then saying \"No\" or \"Yes\" doesn't matter. Meanwhile, if a person is just having sex and doesn't realise that their partner doesn't want it (whether or not this constitutes rape and/or makes the aggressor a rapist, I'm not sure. The Wikipedia article was unhelpful on that), then a simple \"No\" would easily deter the aggressor, and any intimidation on the part of the victim is unnecessary. Ergo, I don't see why it would ever be hard or unideal to say no, and you should probably always do it, because surely almost all people will respect your decline and stop?\n\n**Embarrassment to say \"No\" isn't an excuse**\n\nElaborating on that example a little. Let's say a guy has brought a girl home from a bar. They've been talking and kissing, and the guy has come to the conclusion that she wants to sleep with him. However, the girl actually didn't want to do that. But at this point, she's in his home, possibly in his bed, undressed, and it'd be embarrassing to say no. I can understand that, and I can understand that it would be courteous for the guy to have one final check before having sex. But what I don't like about this is how the woman's embarrassment - a sentimental failure - somehow excuses her (what I think is a) responsibility to just say no. In all arguments I've read, opponents of the \"Yes means Yes\" standard are criticised for their reliance on the sentimental argument; \"Asking for consent risks being un-sexy and deterring my partner\" - as losing out on some sex shouldn't trump a measure against rape. But then why does the victim's embarrassment trump a measure against rape? That's why I think embarrassment on behalf of the victim isn't a fair point either.\n\n**The standard would make having sex difficult**\nFinally, my friends also disagreed with aforementioned argument against the standard altogether - that asking for consent could be a mood-breaker. According to them, most women they know would actually find a consent check more sexy, in addition to being grateful for the courtesy. At this point, our disagreements mostly descended into anecdotes (I'm willing to accept anecdotes and 'life experience' as evidence here, since I believe it can be valid, but it's less effective than solid data). Everything I've ever seen or been told makes me believe that a woman, generally, wants a man to be forward, and confident, i.e. \"So, do you want to have sex?\", or \"Do I have your consent?\" would be a turn-off. I've actually seen \"Can I kiss you\" be openly mocked and criticised by characters in TV shows on several occasions, and that's basically a more mild consent check. And, since my friends are all quite left-wing and quite involved in sexual assault debates, I didn't think that they or their circle of friends would provide an accurate sample of the population. I'm quite convinced that with 9/10 women in Western Europe or the US, a consent check would be met with anything between eye-rolling and open mockery.\n\n**I'd be on-board if it was widespread**\n\nTo clarify one more thing; I actually like the idea of this standard *on principle*. It would clear up a lot of the legal issues for both sides. I like practical solutions, and this is a practical solution; it would probably lower the incidence of rapes where the victim did not feel they were in a position to say no (still not sure how common these cases are). If society was already using it, then I'd be right on board, but it isn't, and enforcing the standard would jeopardize the sex lives of a lot of people, I feel, in exchange for *maybe* lowering the rates of rape which could be avoided by saying \"No\".\n\n**TL;DR:** People should just be able to say \"No\" in all cases I can imagine, and yet this isn't done for the same emotional reasons that proponents of the view are criticising their opponents of having (that the standard is a mood-killer). And I firmly believe that this WOULD be the case; most women would not appreciate being asked for affirmation. I like the idea for bringing legal rigour to an area where a lot of innocent people are both raped and accused of rape, but enforcing this (currently minority) view would make things (and by things I mean sex) difficult for me and many others.\n_____\n\n> *Hello, users of CMV!

However, I think anyone who says Trump's presidency will be the beginning of fascism in America is exaggerating at best, fearmongering at worst.\n\nWhat a lot of people forget when making these comparisons are the insane amounts of checks and balances in the United States government.  The government was designed to be bloated and inefficient for the sole purpose of making a Trump harder to have all of his policies put into action, not to mention the amount of rivalry that occurs between administrations in the government.  I see Trump being more like Richard Nixon, bending the authority of the executive branch as far as it can go before eventually being threatened with impeachment over some sort of malpractice or inflammatory statements.  I don't believe Congress would allow Trump to go as far as so many people believe he will in regards to his immigration policies and stance towards Muslims, even if there is a Republican majority in both the House and the Senate when he starts his first term.  I don't know, I feel like it's a bunch of people trying to make dystopian fantasies come to life, rather than the more likely outcome being Trump will probably end up impeached by his own undoing before America gets even close to that scenario.",

            "selftext": "This is counterintuitive, but hear me out. \n\nSuppose Bernie wins the presidential election next year, to begin with he is up against a hostile Republican majority Congress. Furthermore,  the political scene is so divided that in order to hope for re-election, every Republican will have to take a stand against him. In the midterm elections those who support trump and Cruz now and will be especially motivated to vote in even more Republicans. This will cause the currently hostile Congress to grow even more hostile and partisan which on the whole will be detrimental towards not only whatever Bernie ways to do, but toward the ability of our country to function. \n\nAll in all, aside from executive orders Bernie will not be able to almost anything, and all the policies that you, the Bernie supporter stand for, will not happen. \n\nOn the other hand, suppose Cruz or trump win the presidency. First of all the majority of Democrats in Congress will oppose most of what he will try to do. Even more importantly, many, if not most, of the Republicans in Congress will join with the Democrats in opposition because the majority of Republican politicians don't like either trump or Cruz . Furthermore, I can't think of anything that will cause a Democrat majority in Congress like a Cruz presidency. The groundswell supporting Bernie will be better served in \"obtaining\" Congress. \n\nHaving laid that out, I want to make my final point. While presidency makes a great news story, Congress, when functioning, can do a lot more than the president. Consider kasich, who just defunded planned parenthood, if he were president, but the Democrats had a majority in Congress, planned parenthood in America will be fine. On the other hand, if Hillary or Bernie were president, but Congress remains majority Republican, planned parenthood is screwed.\n\nTLDR: a nutty Republican president galvanizes the public to a Democrat majority Congress which will get more done than a Bernie presidency which will only antagonize an already hostile Republican majority Congress \n\nA note: I understand that, in theory, we can have both presidency and Congress be Democrat, I just think that realistically it won't happen. \n\n\nEdited: a typo",

However, as the election progresses, more and more Americans are becoming a committed supporter of this man. In the last Republican debate, Trump even said he could kill someone on the streets, and people would still love him (I'm sorry I don't have the source for this, I'm still new here). Trump's growing blind support reminds me a lot of Hitler's beginning suppoters. Trump even uses propaganda, media, and theatrical performances in order to get attention like Hitler did. Is the future of America as bleak as i think it is? Or am I just a pessimist?\n\nI had this conversation with my dad who also follows politics. He is not a Trump supporter, however he also doesn't think I can compare him to Hitler. Since he didn't explain why, I was wondering if anyone on here could.

            "selftext": "I hear constant comparisons between Bernie Sanders and Donald Trump, because they are each channeling \"anti-establishment\" feeling in their respective parties. But I don't think the comparison makes any sense. I think the much better analogue to Bernie Sanders is Ted Cruz:\n\n1. Sanders and Cruz are both senators; Trump has no experience working in government.\n2. Sanders and Cruz are known for going against the party leadership of their own party in Cruz's case or the party they caucus with in Sanders's (though I guess he's a Democrat now as a candidate) because they do not consider the mainstream of their parties to be pure enough, and that's the basis of their claim to \"outsider\" or \"anti-establishment\" status. Trump's claim to be an outsider is because he's literally never has a job as a public servant. \n3. Both of them are largely known for their \"no\" votes and their \"principled stances\" rather than their legislative accomplishments. Trump sees himself as a deal-maker.\n4. Sanders and Cruz are both highly ideological. As far as national American politics goes Bernie Sanders is definitely on the far left - he is considered the most liberal member of the Senate, and Ted Cruz, who I do consider a right-wing extremist, is considered the most conservative. Donald Trump is a xenophobe with authoritarian tendencies, but his actual positions on issues that don't touch those two tendencies are all over the map, and he's completely changed his position on just about every major issue over the years. \n\nCMV?\n_____\n\n> *Hello, users of CMV!

Instead, without any guidance, and being agitated by the media, people respond to anger and rejection of the media and of politicians, that they see in Trump, who seems to be effective at agitating the media and other politicians.  In following Trump they (knowingly) disavow themselves of voting in a president who will protect democracy because they now longer know what that looks like or even care.   Thus the angry Trump supporter chooses openly accept the failure of democracy. \n\nI realize that there is a lot going on in premise 3, but bear with me,  I know there are a lot of deeper undercurrents in media and common discourse that affect partisan divides, but that is beside my conclusion. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n_____\n\n> *Hello, users of CMV!

            "selftext": "Hello. I'm a pretty big Bernie Sanders fan, but I've come to realize that he probably won't win the nomination. Obama was able to blow pass Clinton thanks to the youth vote and voters of color. Bernie has the youth vote in spades, he's got 85% of it but he doesn't have the black vote which makes up about 40% of key states. Also, young people are shitty with politics, we never vote--if you're old enough to vote, and you don't then ughh.\n\nI don't think Hillary Clinton is a bad person. I think she'd be a better president than Obama and probably would have supported her in 2008 had I been old enough to vote then and had I known what I do now. That being said, I don't think she could win against the Republicans.\n\n1. She's the Republican anti-christ. Obama only has a 46% approval rating, Clinton's approval rating looks pretty similar. The Republicans being the incumbent party have an advantage, and that advantage will only grow if Obama sinks further in the polls. The Republicans will throw everything they got to keep her out of the White House; and attacks on Clinton have largely worked, her approval rating has dropped like a stone since she became Secretary of State. She dropped from 65% approval to 41%. If she were to become the President of the United States she'd be the most unpopular person to win ever. Donald Trump is far less popular, but he has a far more passionate fanbase, that could push him slightly ahead of Clinton.\n\n2. She can't inspire passion. She's winning because she's a part of an entrenched system, because millennials don't vote and the Sanders campaign has failed to engage voters of color. She's not winning because people like her and are excited to see her in the White House. I have zero faith that she'd manage to bring out excitement or loyalty in the voting base come the election season.\n\n3. She's not an amazing debater. She comes across as rehearsed and *always* gives the answer you'd expect. For a politician she's a great speaker, always manages to answer a question without *really* answering it. But when it comes to someone like Trump, someone who is the exact opposite I think she'd do embarrassingly bad. He'd come across as speaking from the heart, speaking passionately and she'd come across as someone reading mental notecards and taking the \"correct\" position her staff told her to take.\n\n4. Political funding is a huge issue in this election. Clinton is funded by wealthy people, she has lots of backing of establishment democrats and large groups (who oddly enough seem to have a personal tie to her campaign, like a son or daughter on her campaign team) but Trump is self funded. It would be so easy to attack her for being in the pocket of the wealthy, and Trump himself has stories about how he used money to influence Clinton in the past. These attacks have worked in the past, and they'd work again against Clinton.\n\n5. The Republicans have the advantage thanks to voter ID laws and being incumbent.\n\nI'd support Clinton in a heartbeat if nominated, but I don't expect to win.\n\n_____\n\n> *Hello, users of CMV!

            "selftext": "This is a proposition that a few months ago I would have thought to be ridiculous. However, the electoral calculus of this election has changed completely, and we are at the precipice of a rare partisan realignment in American history. If Trump and Hill win their respective nominations, Trump has several key advantages that will allow him to dominate over her. \n\n**1. Trump is a moderate republican with populist appeal** \n\nIf Trump even tries to move to the middle to attract support from the anti-establishment left, he will defeat Hill. For the general, he must move to the center and distance himself from his more conservative racist rhetoric. If he does this successfully, he can attract Sanders supporters (not all, obviously). He shares views with Sanders on trade, healthcare (?), campaign finance, iraq war, trade deals, and others. If his campaign focuses on these, he will attract Bernie supporters. Which leads to my second advantage- \n\n**2. Trump will be in full attack mode**\n\nDon's populist stances work perfectly to contrast himself from Hill. Sanders has used a moderate amount of attacks against Hill and gotten a lot of ground. Trump will be merciless, attacking Hill on nearly every front. Here is a hypothetical future Trump monologue taken from [this article](http://www.zerohedge.com/news/2016-02-25/why-hillary-clinton-cannot-beat-donald-trump): \n>\u201cShe lies so much. Everything she says is a lie. I\u2019ve never seen someone who lies so much in my life. Let me tell you three lies she\u2019s told. She made up a story about how she was ducking sniper fire! There was no sniper fire. She made it up! How do you forget a thing like that? She said she was named after Sir Edmund Hillary, the guy who climbed Mount Everest. He hadn\u2019t even climbed it when she was born! Total lie! She lied about the emails, of course, as we all know, and is probably going to be indicted. You know she said there were weapons of mass destruction in Iraq! It was a lie! Thousands of American soldiers are dead because of her. Not only does she lie, her lies kill people. That\u2019s four lies, I said I\u2019d give you three. You can\u2019t even count them. You want to go on PolitiFact, see how many lies she has? It takes you an hour to read them all! In fact, they ask her, she doesn\u2019t even say she hasn\u2019t lied. They asked her straight up, she says she usually tries to tell the truth! Ooooh, she tries! Come on! This is a person, every single word out of her mouth is a lie. Nobody trusts her. Check the polls, nobody trusts her. Yuge liar.\u201d\n\nTrump will utilize the attacks of the Sander's campaign but without any restraint. He will attack her wallstreet connections, demand she release the transcripts, criticize her Iraq war position, her change of heart on trade policy, change of heart on gay marriage, ect. Hillary conventionally should move to the middle during a general election-- this will only attract more anti-establishment left to Trump. Hill will be on the defensive the entire time, she will have to constantly come up with reasons why she won't release her transcripts or defend her ties to financial institutions. Hillary won't be able to level offensive attacks against Trump because he has been far effective at sliding off criticism. Moreover, Hillary's attacks cannot focus on trump's substantive policy positions because those are too popular with Sander's supporters (besides immigration and a few others). She will try and characterize him as a sexist racist, but Trump will respond with criticism of his own that Bernie has stayed away from-- Hillary's sexist remarks to Lewisnky and others, and the use of \"super predator\" to characterize black children. He will attack the Clintons on their mass incarceration/welfare policies which decimated black communities. Which leads to my third point-- \n\n**3. Trump is a far better campaigner than Hillary**\n \nEverything Trump does is calculated. For example, one of the key narratives of his campaign is that there is a constant media bias against him. There is debate as to whether this is actually true, but it certainly fits into the cohesive message of his campaign: the media represents corporations which control politicians which are ALL a part of the establishment. This allows Trump to successfully deflect most criticism against him. Moreover, it attracts supporters from another candidate who has been the victim of a so-called media bias. Sanders fans, of course, understand the media bias in favor of Hillary. Trump will characterize the establishment in favor of Hillary, thus delegitimizing all attacks that are made against him. Media bias is no longer a negative force against a candidate-- in fact, Trump has found a way to make it work for him. The best example is this KKK endorsement drama. During an interview, Trump didn't clearly condemn the KKK mans endorsement. Immediately after, he disavowed any KKK endorsement at a speech. The media predictably lashes onto the interview statements and portrays Trump as a KKK sympathizer. He says he disavowed that endorsement, and reinforces the huge media bias thats against him, which energizes his supporters. Hillary will have anything but a media bias against her. The media has been constantly on her side, so Trumps attacks will not easily be deflected. Sanders, on the other hand, is a victim of media bias.   _____\n\n**4. Repubs are not as factional as we think**\n\nThe republican base has more energy then it ever has. The voter turnout for all primaries has reached record levels. The democratic turnout, however, is quite low compared to 2008/2012. There is going to be large amounts of voter fatigue from a candidate like Hillary. She has failed to have a strong grassroots movement and has not energized her party. The republicans, although fighting now, will absolutely coalesce around Trump if he wins. The democrats however, will not be as successful. If Trump moves to the center, the desire to vote \"against\" Trump will diminish. This mixed with the fact that people don't really want to vote \"for\" Hillary is serious bad news. \n\n\nThere are definitely more reasons why Trump will defeat Hillary. There are just a handful. So reddit, will conventional wisdom win out, or will the electoral calculus of this election change forever? \n> *Hello, users of CMV! This is a footnote from your moderators.

            "selftext": "There has been a lot of discussion on political subreddits, mostly /r/politics, about Sanders chances to win the nomination. The overall consensus stands that Sanders is hopeful, but not likely to win the nomination. However, I've viewed a disturbing trend among Sanders supporters that manifests itself with a lot of people promising to vote for Donald Trump or another Republican nominee instead of Hillary Clinton in the general election to spite the DNC.\n\nThis is crazy. Bernie Sanders is a progressive, and a staunch liberal. If one is in support of Sanders, then why would they ever vote for a conservative? Every single Republican nominee holds a majority of views that are strictly contradictory to Sanders policies. Whether it be funding government programs, pushing cultural and social programs and movements, tax policies, fiscal and monetary policy, etc. Sanders is opposite to nearly all Republican candidates. Trump may hold the same anti-establishment appeal that Sanders does, but that doesn't mean they are equatable in any way.\n\nClinton, for all her faults, is still a moderate-liberal. Her public policy would be less drastic, but still in the spirit of Sanders public policy. Those who would suddenly support a conservative because they couldn't get their radical liberal candidate, are not liberal or progressive at all. They are simply anti-establishment, and that is not a good thing. It means that they support nothing other than to go against \"the system.\" But there has to be a system of some kind. Wanting to break the political system without offering an alternative or reform is irresponsible and detrimental to American society.\n\nEDIT: So a few individuals have convinced me that there are a few ways in which one could justify voting for Trump if they don't get a Sanders nomination. I'd like also to clarify something. My insinuation within all of this is that it is irresponsible to be anti-establishment at all costs. I still believe that, but there are a few legitimate explanations for why one would vote Republican or Trump if they can't get Sanders.",

He's got double digit leads in too many states.  \n\n\nMarco Rubio - Senator from Florida - is losing to Trump by double digits in the polls.... in Florida. \nThe Latest polls have trump up by 5-10 points in Ohio (where Kasich is governor). \nIf you can't win at home, you gotta get out of the race.\n\n\n\n I don't see why Ben Carson is still going. He can't even get a word in edgewise at debates anymore. \nThe anti-trump vote is being split between the other 4 candidates. \nYou might say \"If lower candidates drop out, Trump will get some of that vote\"\nThat's true to some extent - but there is definitely an anti Trump base in the republican electorate. [Meg Whitman called Trump unfit to be president when she bashed her former ally Chris Christie for endorsing Trump](http://www.nytimes.com/politics/first-draft/2016/02/28/meg-whitman-assails-chris-christie-for-backing-donald-trump/) I don't know how large the anti-Trump base is - but it's there and it's being divided between other candidates. \n\n\nUp until Trump destroyed them both in Nevada, Rubio and Cruz have been fighting over 2nd place thinking that when Trump inevitably crashes and burns, they will be the new front runner. I've been watching and they're attacking each other as if that matters. Meanwhile trump is running away with the race. But the debate in Texas (after the Nevada results) was just an all out assault on Donald Trump.\nThe strategy of fighting over 2nd place was a bad one - because Trump never crashed. After Nevada, they realized that if Trump ever were going to crash for making an outlandish statement - that would have happened months ago. His loudmouth clown behavior appeals to the angry republican electorate. \n\nTed Cruz is winning decisively in Texas - the largest super Tuesday state. That could give him momentum to beat trump in the future. Also Cruz has some momentum after beating trump in Iowa. Rubio came 3rd, 3rd, 2nd, 2nd, in the early states. That's not a strong foot hold to go into super Tuesday. \n\nRight now it's hard to see a way Trump does not become the republican nominee. But Ted Cruz is really the only one with any semblance of a chance.  Other candidates are just too far behind.  Time is running out - the longer Rubio, Carson and Kasich stay in the race - the larger Trump's lead is going to get. \n\n_____\n\n> *Hello, users of CMV! This is a footnote from your moderators.

So GOP best option is just hope he beats Hillary and hope they can get someone more conservative in there next time.

            "selftext": "**EDIT** : I've now voted. Nobody that commented was able to change my mind. Thanks for the input, though!\n\n---\n\nI've personally narrowed down my choice between Cruz and Rubio, but am leaning towards Cruz for tomorrow's vote. \nStill, I wanted to put out there where my head is at with each and see if Rubio supporters can convince me to switch. I'm also open to hearing Cruz supporters chime in here, too.   \n  \nHere is where I currently stand:\n  \n---\n\n**Rubio**  \nI think he takes a lot of the usual Democrats ammunition in a general. He's Hispanic and can speak Spanish. He hasn't been wealthy for most of his life, living paycheck to paycheck and having school loans he had to pay back. If anything, I feel like they'd hit him on the usual \"War on Women\" rhetoric -- but they're going to do that no matter who it is. I feel like Rubio speaks better when he's off-script, in a more conversational and personable way.   \n\nPersonally, as someone that liked Rand Paul, I don't like Rubio's stance on the NSA surveillance, though. And I sort of get the impression that he views the Constitution as a guideline -- a good one, sure, but if he feels like something must be done then that's his motive regardless of what the Constitution says. An example of that would be his shutting down mosques if it's believed that recruiting for radical Islam takes place (See http://goo.gl/ZmY86l).   \n\nI also generally don't hold the Gang of 8 thing against him, as I understand that bi-partisan efforts make things happen. But him saying he wouldn't do that and then doing it doesn't sit well with me.  \n\nFinally, what's turned me off a lot on Rubio in the past weekend is his new campaign tactic. I get it; he had a good debate Thursday and made Trump look foolish. And I get that the best way to beat Trump is to make him look like a joke, using his very own words and actions against him. I just think it should have been done months ago, at the onset even. Now, it looks childish. I was at a Rubio rally where he read tweets with spelling errors to the crowd and made fun of them (the idea being Trump must have hired a foreigner to work for him as he has in the past). Over the weekend, these kinds of silly attacks continued, where I read he said, \"Donald Trump likes to sue people. He should sue whoever did that to his face\" (see http://goo.gl/KUfpdT). I'm sorry, but to me that's no different than Trump insulting Carly over her looks. He kept it classy for so long and I get it, it didn't work, and the voters apparently like meanness (since Trump does it all the time and leads), so Marco is doing it now. But it coming so late just seems desperate.  \n\nFinally was this story in the NY Times over the weekend that Rubio worked with (read: coerced) conservative media (read: Fox News) on how to report (see http://goo.gl/RWiD1i). Now, he's probably not the only one that's done that. But he's running for President, so it's fair game.  \n\n---\n\n**Cruz**  \nI agree the most with his platform and policies of all that are still in the race. I like how devoted he is to the Constitution, as an originalist, and I have no worries about what he'd do as President. He's been very consistent, both in his ideas and this very campaign.  \n\nI just worry that his persona isn't something that will win over enough people in the general election. He can sometimes sound like a televangelist when he speaks, and I can see that as a big turn-off. I worry that his standoff-ish style is also something that could be used against him. And while I don't fault the Iowa/Carson robocall -- I feel someone else would've done it, I mean Carson did say he was leaving Iowa to go to Florida -- or the mailer in Iowa (Obama used the same tactic in 2008), the one thing that did get me was the fake-as-all-hell photo of Rubio and Obama together (see http://goo.gl/Za5HWN).  \n\nI also went to a Cruz rally, by the way. It was far more substantive and, though there were little jokes here and there, it was not the crux of the presentation. Furthermore, Cruz signed autographs and took photos with attendees for a good while afterwards. Something Rubio did not do at his.  \n\n---  \n\nIn the end, I like Cruz more, but think Rubio would be better in the general. But that thought of mine is fading, and I almost feel like I'd rather vote for someone with whom I more agree with and hope for the best in the general than someone I don't agree with as much and just think will do better.  Which brings me to Ted Cruz.  \n  \nCan anyone convince me that I should be voting for Rubio instead?\n\n_____\n\n> *Hello, users of CMV! This is a footnote from your moderators.

            "selftext": "Oddly enough, I say this as a relatively liberal voter. Here's my reasoning:\n\n1: The Republican party is not just going to wither and die completely. There are enough votes to be gained from just being the opposition party that so long as they're willing to speak out against the ruling Democrats, they'll get enough votes to sometimes control the legislature, and sometimes just obstruct it.\n\n2: The American Government is established in such a way that the Republican party will always have the power to disrupt things, if that's all they're trying to do. We've seen this for the last several years now: Between shutdowns, fillibusters and everything else, the Democratic party has been able to gain very little ground in terms of policy, even in years in which they've done well at the voting booth.\n\n3: So long as the Republican party isn't nationally competitive, they have no reason to appeal to moderates. In the current state of affairs, the bulk of the party is concerned with appealing to their primary voters, or voters in highly gerrymandered districts/\"Red States\". They've established the best way to win over those voters is to be confrontational and extremist. So long as those are the only voters they think they can get, those are the only ones they'll reach out to.\n\n4: So long as the Republicans aren't in power, they're motivated to keep things bad. Right now, Obama would get credit for any successes or improvements that came out of government. If they compromise, the Democrats look like winners. \n\nAll of those things combine to form a political landscape where so long as they remain disruptive and cater to their own fringe elements, they can keep just enough power to continue to do so. However, re-gaining the white house is going to require a strong appeal to moderate voters, and actually *holding* the white house is going to get them invested in making actual improvements and keeping the process moving, even if it means cooperation. When the Republican party gets strong again, it will get better in the process.\n\nNow, I'm not saying we should all go out and vote for Trump. But, I think if you care about the political situation in this country improving, you should be listening for a saner, more appealing voice to come out of the right.\n_____\n\n> *Hello, users of CMV!

            "selftext": "I believe that it's safe to say this on Reddit because I am inclined to believe that most Redditors are at least informed, at most smart, and probably not Trump fans.\n\nThink about it. Donald Trump, whether you love him, hate him, or are indifferent, is tearing the Republicans to shreds. They tolerate him less and less, and have since turned on him completely. The GOP leadership knows he's bad for them, but he's a monster they created; he feeds off of the hate, fear, and ignorance spread by them themselves, and he isn't saying anything that they and the other candidates aren't saying. He's just saying it louder and without their subtlety. He didn't create these things, they already existed.\n\nSo what do we do? Everyone hates him, but is he really bad? What if he was destroying them on purpose? Whether you believe that part or not, the outcome is the same: if he is nominated, a Democrat will win the election, no contest. And he very well be nominated. \n\nI think the left should secretly support Trump to ensure he gets the nomination, and then, of course, go full Dem during the main event. It may seem risky, but there is absolutely no way he could get elected. And if it seems it will be a race between Trump and \"x\" Dem, I think people on our side will band together, and will most likely band with the Bern, who carries the most excitement and momentum. \n\n_____\n\n> *Hello, users of CMV!

These people increasingly look at the \"other guy\" (Trump or Sanders) as a 2nd choice for their general election vote.\n\nSo they support Sanders, but if it's Trump vs Clinton they'll vote Trump. Or they support Trump, but if it's Cruz vs Sanders they'll vote for Sanders.\n\nI believe the groups of people who support these two men are not separate camps of people, but rather they create a distinct Venn diagram with significant overlap. I also think this fact will serve to discredit any current polling data should either man receive his party's nomination.\n\nChange my view.\n\n_____\n\n> *Hello, users of CMV!

IN THE EVENT that Hillary is nominated, I plan on voting for her.\n\n**Trump has said he wants to:**\n\n*[Kill the women and children of terrorists](http://www.msnbc.com/msnbc/trump-isis-you-have-take-out-their-families) and [defended that view](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xOUup9foyMA) \n\n*[Take away press freedoms under the First Amendment](http://www.cnn.com/2016/02/28/opinions/trump-first-amendment-protections-opinion-randazza/)\n\n*Deport 11 million people, [including their citizen children.](https://www.washingtonpost.com/posteverything/wp/2015/11/12/donald-trumps-immigration-plan-would-cause-u-s-citizens-to-be-deported/)\n\n*[Ban 1 billion Muslims from entering this country.](http://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2015/dec/07/donald-trump-ban-all-muslims-entering-us-san-bernardino-shooting)\n\n*[Censor parts of the internet](http://www.businessinsider.com/donald-trump-wants-to-shut-down-parts-of-the-internet-penetrate-republican-presidential-debate-2015-12)\n\n**He also says he:**\n\n*[Respects Putin's leadership - when asked how he felt about Putin killing journalists](http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2015/dec/18/donald-trump-vladimir-putin-might-kill-journalists/)\n\n*[Loves war](http://www.expressnews.com/news/news_columnists/brian_chasnoff/article/Trump-I-love-war-6630963.php)\n\n*[Thinks soldiers who were captured by the enemy or not heroes, since he likes people who aren't captured.](http://www.politico.com/story/2015/07/trump-attacks-mccain-i-like-people-who-werent-captured-120317) \n\n*[Thinks we should torture even if it doesn't work](http://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2015/nov/24/donald-trump-on-waterboarding-even-if-it-doesnt-work-they-deserve-it), and [he plans on doing worse than waterboarding](http://abcnews.go.com/Politics/wireStory/trump-favors-torture-illegal-37283527).\n\nI'll finish by quoting Matt Dillahunty from the Atheist Experience:\n\n*\"I've seen people claim that they won't vote because they simply won't be guilty of empowering the 'lesser of two evils'. Do they not understand that withholding their vote might help ensure that control is handed over to the greater of two evils (under their view)?\nHow much do you have to hate yourself to support, by withholding your voice, the candidate that you view as the greater evil?

Things have always gone according to the elites plans, the candidate that is backed by the banks and the corporations always wins and they always get their way. The few \"movements\" against this like occupy wallstreet, Bernie, Ron Paul, they have all been pretty much mocked and put down without any influence at all on the way the system works. The elite never even broke a sweat against any of these movements, and dropped a few million here or there for some campaign to take down the annoyance. They thought that the common people had no power whatsoever. \n\nBut then there was Trump. Somehow this guy has singlehandedly struck so much fear into CEOs, bankers, and the other oligarchs in other countries that they have all combined forces in a multi party movement to stop him. Republican and democrat no longer seem to matter, the whole republican and democratic establishment has turned their full attention to stopping trump, the entire media spends all day trying to trip him up and if he ever so much as blinks at the wrong they they publish hundreds of stories to mock him for it. Every country on earth is tarnishing his name in their countries and plotting against Trump, with China and Mexico sending statements every day telling the USA that they better not elect Trump. CEOs and bankers are throwing endless amounts of money at both democrats and republicans to stop Trump, with seemingly no limit on what they will spend to do so. I mean this one man may have had more success against the global elite so far than anyone else in history to date. I feel like this is the one shot we have to tell them that they dont have all the power, that they dont control everything and that sometimes they have to listen to the people. I feel like if Trump doesnt make it into at least the nomination this time around, the global elite will seal the few existing cracks in their defenses and they will consolidate control for the next couple centuries. \n\nso basically, CMV and tell me why my analysis of this is wrong. at least convince me that all these elites are not actually as threatened by trump as they appear to be. and tell me why I should vote for the presumptive hillary (the poster child of the global elite oligarchy) over Trump even if I dont agree with Trump on much. \n\n_____\n\n> *Hello, users of CMV!

A lot of interesting and insightful answers. I think I have a better picture of these two guys now.\n\n**Trump**: I see Trump's figure is being manipulated strongly by the media, with much of his comments being taken out of context. He's saying a lot of things that many americans want to hear. Apparently there's a difference between his \"show figure\" and his actual positions, which are considered pretty traditionally American by many of you. And a lot of comments refer to Trump's business achievements as something positive, skills that would be reflected in the country if he's elected.\n\nI sense there's a feeling of overall dissatisfaction with Obama, may be helped by the social media. I can't help but think that Trump's biggest strenght is pretty much being a big anti-Obama reaction in many ways: politically, socially and economically.\n\n**Bernie**: Many of you said that you like Bernie's positions and that much of them should be good for the people, but the problem is they're pretty much utopic or unrealistic. Others stated that his vision of the economy would harm America and that the fact that he doesn't have \"real\" achievements in politics or comparing to Trump, in any business at all, is something pretty negative.\n\nThe bottom-line as I see it and that it was pointed out by some of you is that both of them are running heavily ideological campaigns, which makes them very similar characters, each in their own way.",

            "selftext": "2016 should have been the year the Republicans started to make some headway at broadening the tent of its coalition, given that was their consensus after 2012. However between a chaotic primary season where nearly every candidate has been portrayed as a clown car in contrast to the Democrats, the prospect of Trump as the nominee causing permanent damage to the GOP brand, the party in outright civil war and the prospect of the party splitting as a result of this election, it seems they have made zero steps forward and fifty steps steps backward in this regard.\n\nNot to mention, many of the demographic trends in this country are heavily in favor of the Democrats, particularly with women, Hispanics and other minorities. The GOP base is proving especially resistant to any prospect of creating a more inclusive party which is forcing moderate candidates to appeal to the right, particularly social conservatives, in order to win votes in the primaries but alienate other voters in the general as seen with McCain and Romney's campaigns. And Trump is almost the perfect candidate for Hillary to not only run against in a landslide, but associate the GOP brand with every word in the book from racist to sexist, xenophobic, insane, crazy, fascist, anti-intellectual, out of touch, etc. That is if statements made by other members of the party from Cruz to LaPage to Imhofe haven\u2019t already painted that image already.\n\nAs of now, the future of the GOP is looking incredibly dire. The party is deeply divided and likely to continue infighting well after this election is over, their efforts at outreaching to other demographics have gone up in flames thanks to Trump which is going to drive even more Hispanics and other demographics into the Democrats camp and lead to a landslide defeat unseen in a while, many independent voters despise the GOP for being the chief cause of Congressional gridlock and obstructionism due to the fiscal cliff fight in 2011, the shutdown in 2013, and the recent impasse over Scalia's replacement, on top of so many of their members continuing to hold increasingly unpopular views regarding SSM, climate change denial, abortion, etc. The Southern Strategy that the GOP had relied on for so long to build their coalition is proving to be an albatross due to perceived notions of race-baiting, advocating voter ID laws, \"Tough on crime\" stances and so on. And in addition, the Republican's traditional platform of \"Low tax, small government, free markets\" that has been their bread and butter since Reagan is no longer resonating with what appears to be an increasingly more liberal/progressive electorate that associates those policies with rising income inequality and who are strongly more in favor of a European/Nordic style social democracy with universal health care, strong safety nets to curtail inequality, all funded for by high taxes on the rich. Even the prospect of the GOP turning more libertarian and abandoning social conservatism may not be enough to stem this.\n\nIn short, the unpopularity of many of the GOP's positions on top of a growing coalition in favor of the Democrats and their policies, and the chaos ensued by Trump's campaign is giving the perception that the GOP is dead and may never contend for an election again. They certainly won't be able to challenge Hillary in 2020 due to her incumbency advantage, and it remains uncertain if they can resolve its civil war in time to complete a realignment when all the demographic trends favor the Dems. I\u2019ve heard some say the GOP can challenge the Dems in 2024, others think it may very well be into the 2030\u2019s until we see another Republican president. To wit we may very well be looking at years of uncontested Democratic supremacy in the government once the Census redistricts the House in favor of the Dems and the SCOTUS turns more liberal. \n\nTo summarize, everything seems to be hopeless for the GOP because they are unable or unwilling to rebrand themselves while everything is turning up great for the Dems in the long run as a permanent Democratic majority is seemingly about to take shape locking the GOP out of the White House for decades and sealing the fate of conservatism and the American right wing forever.\n\nHow in what way may I be wrong about this prediction?\n_____\n\n> *Hello, users of CMV!

This attitude continued up until the late 19th century, when the first Drumpf immigrated to the United States. \n\n[WW1 led to even more intense anti-German sentiment. ](http://www.immigrantentrepreneurship.org/entry.php?rec=214#h11)The language itself was banned from most official and spiritual offices. At this point, German Americans had began to make name changes, as [\"Just having a German name was cause enough for the American Protective League to launch an investigation into a person\u2019s private affairs. \"](http://www.authentichistory.com/1914-1920/2-homefront/4-hysteria/). \n\nWith this historical context in mind, the fact that the Drumpf family had their name changed to Trump sometime after the 1880s is not something to be used as criticism, especially since Trump is often criticized for his anti-immigrant policies. \n\nHis tolerance for extremism, the lack of any true, well thought out plan for public office, his populism, and the isolationist views are all good points for criticism, not his family's original name.\n\n[Here's an article from the New York Times I found.](http://www.nytimes.com/2016/03/03/us/politics/donald-drumpf-a-funny-label-but-is-it-fair.html)\n\n**I've learned that mocking someone's name doesn't exactly count as true criticism, and I've misinterpreted the video.

            "selftext": "Bernie is very quick to polls that have him 7-10 points ahead of potential republican nominees. But you know polls at this point mean nothing.  Polls at this point had McCain and Romney 5 points ahead of Obama and Obama won both of those EASILY. Those results were not close. \n\n**1. Hillary Clinton is battle tested. Bernie Sanders is not.**\nThey'v been throwing attacks at Hillary for 25 years. If they had anything substantive on her, she'd be in jail or retired from politics at this point. There's nothing new you can throw at her. All those attacks have failed. Bernie Sanders has only been elected in Vermont where nearly the entire electorate is very progressive. He's never been tested across the country against the republican attack machine. \n\nHave you seen recent republican debates? They were an all out assault on Donald Trump. Do you think Trump or any other republican is going to play nice with Bernie? We can all agree - the general election is gonna get nasty. They are probably going to make up false dirt to throw at Bernie; Hillary's been taking false dirt for 25 years and she aint dead yet. \n\n**2. Bernie Sanders does not have an attack dog inside him.**\n\nBernie has said multiple times he has never run a negative ad in his whole life. Bernie's \"attacks\" on Hillary have been weak. He has tied her to Wall Street, really that's about it. \n\n You might find his \"lets-stay-positive\" attitude to be inspiring but you cannot win the general election without attacking your opponent. You have to run negative ads - they will be running them against you.  Bernie has not responded very well to Hillary's attacks. She hit him on immigration and gun control and his response was lackluster. \n\n\n\n**3. Hillary as the nominee will turn guaranteed red states blue.**\n Clintons are well loved in the south and the around the Mississippi River. Have a look at [2016 primary results from Georgia, Arkansas, Tennesee, Alabama, Virginia and South Carolina](http://www.cnn.com/specials/politics/super-tuesday-2016). Hillary won and BY HUGE MARGINS. Bernie campaigned very hard in SC and got a 3-to-1 thumping across the South.   \n\n   Take a look at these election results from [1992](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_presidential_election,_1992) and [1996](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_presidential_election,_1996). \nLouisiana, Arkansas, Kentucky, Tennessee, West Virginia, Arizona... These are considered hard red states today but they went blue for Bill Clinton TWICE. Georgia went blue for Clinton once. \nBernie is from Vermont. All of New England is guaranteed blue anyway.\n_____\n\n> *Hello, users of CMV! This is a footnote from your moderators. We'd just like to remind you of a couple of things.

            "selftext": "Hearing Mitt Romney's speech today made me realize something: Moderate Liberals and Moderate Conservatives don't differ on that many areas. Both are for equal legal rights for all, for separation of church and state, etc. The most that they bicker on are entitlements, which are just a drop in the budget anyways. We have more in common with each other than we do with insane extremists like the Social Justice Warriors Left and the Tea Party Right.\n\nSeeing Romney even give a speech like that made me realize if only the Republican Party had dealt with the Tea Party insurrection correctly when it popped up, Trump may never have gained traction to the extent he did. We on the Left are seeing insane extremists pop up screaming to curtail First Amendment Rights and Due Process Rights, who believe Journalists are about crafting a narrative rather than reporting facts, killing cops is good, etc. If the Democratic Party doesn't deal with these people like the Republicans didn't really do with the Tea Party, it isn't that inconceivable that in 8 years we see a frothing SJW lunatic screaming about microagressions and air conditioner temperatures (not unlike Trump's fixation with walls and birth certificates) hijack the nomination from real liberal candidates.\n\nIf the Moderates on both sides allied now, it can protect us from the twin menace of SJWs and Tea Party nutjobs. We have common enemies and a lot of similarities, whereas the extremists have more in common with each other than they do with the moderate wings of their own respective parties.\n\nIf we don't ally now, it may be too late. The GOP could remake itself and reunite whereas they are stumbling now, while the SJWs, as mentioned above, could hijack the Democratic Party and hold it hostage like the Tea Party did to the Republicans.\n\nThe SJWs and Tea Party are insane ideological purists who have no qualms about figuratively (maybe literally heh) burning unbelievers at their respective stakes, ask for insane demands (election of Supreme Court judges, criminalizing free speech), cannot be reasoned with, do not respect the Constitution for shit, want theocracies in place, and purge society of those who disagree with them. As the Tea Party keeps getting stronger, it's only natural to fear that rather than just going away, the SJW nutjobs will follow their fellow Tea Party's growth rate.\n\nIn order to Change My View, one would have to successfully address any of these issues:\n\nDo Moderate Liberals and Moderate Conservatives actually clash too much for an alliance to work?\n\nDo the Moderates have more in common with the nutjobs of their party rather than each other?\n\nWould the Moderates allying together now make it more likely for the nutjobs to gain plurality?\n\nWould it be a better time to ally later than now?\n\n_____\n\n> *Hello, users of CMV!

            "selftext": "First, I'll acknowledge that there are many instances of Trump being a strong nationalist. He also is xenophobic to at least some extent, due to his distrust of foreigners and immigrants. And there's no doubt that a high number of his supporters range from lightly to extremely sexist and/or racist. He also clearly is very vulgar, insulting, and resorts to personal insults at the drop of a hat.\n\nHowever, have there been any known examples of him being objectively sexist or racist, when each example is viewed in a charitable light? There are many incidents that have been referred to, however, they all seem ambiguous.\n\nI am not a Trump supporter and never will be, but I don't want to vilify him for things he's not really guilty of.\n\nHe absolutely could have intended to be racist or sexist in some, many, or all of these examples. But I think favorably interpreting things he's said, and his explanations/excuses afterwards, leads to the conclusion that it's plausible he did not have any racist or sexist intention.\n\nHere are some of the most well-known examples, I think:\n\n**Sexism**\n\n* [Trump, referring to Megyn Kelly's supposed anger or grudge towards him, said \"you could see there was blood coming out of her eyes, blood coming out of her... wherever\".](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M28z9y4yT6Y) He doesn't really say it with an innuendo-like or sly tone, and quickly moves onto the next thought. He says he meant it as \"etc.\", as in her nose and ears.\n* [Trump retweeted a statement of another Twitter user calling Megyn Kelly a \"bimbo\".](https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/629553612839124992) I think it's debatable whether \"bimbo\" is an objectively sexist term (edit: or if any term in isolation can be objectively sexist), even if it's a term reserved for women. Also, the tweet expressed a more complex thought than \"she's a bimbo\", and it was not something he wrote himself.\n* [Trump referred to Rosie O'Donnell as a pig and a degenerate.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hlD9REqnxCg) He hasn't used sexualized language when referring to Rosie, and claims he has legitimate reason to have a grudge against her.\n* [Trump said of Carly Fiorina: \"Look at that face! Would anyone vote for that? Can you imagine that, the face of our next president?!\"](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/donald-trump-carly-fiorina_us_55f17d22e4b03784e2781531) He says he was insulting her personality and demeanor, and not her looks. Even if he was insulting her looks, that's not necessarily a sign of sexism, as he's insulted the looks of several men during his campaigning, including other male candidates.\n* [Trump made many crude remarks about women 5-10+ years ago, including \"You know, it doesn't really matter what [the media] write as long as you've got a young and beautiful piece of ass.\"](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/18-real-things-donald-trump-has-said-about-women_us_55d356a8e4b07addcb442023) Some things in this article are very crude and offensive, but given the year that he said them, I feel they would be seen at the time less as sexist and more as \"pig-ish\". Not a great excuse, I know.\n* [On his show *The Apprentice*, Trump made a sexual joke/remark about a former Playboy model contestant: \"That must be a pretty picture -- you dropping to your knees.\"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Gj34WyC0Ng) He was clearly referencing sexual activity there. However, considering the contestant worked for Playboy and the non-serious manner in which he said it, I would see this less as sexist and more \"creepy\" or lewd than anything else.\n\n\n**Racism**\n\n* [In a speech, Trump said \"When Mexico sends its people, they're not sending their best. They're not sending you. They're not sending you. They're sending people that have lots of problems, and they're bringing those problems with us. They're bringing drugs. They're bringing crime. Their rapists. And some, I assume, are good people.\"](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/fact-checker/wp/2015/07/08/donald-trumps-false-comments-connecting-mexican-immigrants-and-crime/) These statements appear to be a result of Trump's conspiracy-theory belief that the Mexican government is intentionally sending criminals to the US illegally. He clarified that he was only referring to illegal immigrants, and not Mexican immigrants in general.\n* [Trump retweeted an image conveying false statistics of black-related homicides.](http://assets.nydailynews.com/polopoly_fs/1.2443283.1448229931!/img/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/article_635/trumptweet23n-1-web.jpg) The person who made the image likely is racist, but this could be a case of believing false facts at face value rather than malice on his part. [He later acknowledged the information was wrong, and said \"Am I going to check every statistic? I get millions and millions of people.\"](http://www.businessinsider.com/bill-oreilly-donald-trump-race-crime-tweet-2015-11). Also, the image doesn't focus on black-on-white homicide. It seems likely he retweeted it to reinforce his narrative that there is a big crime problem that needs resolving. I will admit this is kind of a stretch on my part, though.\n* [Trump hesitated in condemning David Duke and the KKK.](http://www.cnn.com/2016/02/28/politics/donald-trump-white-supremacists/) He claims he had a bad earpiece. In the interview, he does sound genuinely confused, and does not appear to react to \"Ku Klux Klan\", so it's plausible he did not hear that part. Also, he shortly after disavowed Duke, and recently said he is \"a bad person\". He did rebuke him back in 2000, but the fact that he forgot about something that happened 16 years ago seems more like evidence that his egotistical \"perfect memory\" remark is false, rather than evidence of him intentionally hiding the fact that he did have knowledge of Duke.\n\nI'm particularly interested in *other* examples of him saying or doing potentially racist or sexist things, but if someone has a very strong argument against one of my points about the above examples, I'd certainly be open to hearing that, too.",

However, I don't believe this is any different than Charlie Sheen calling Chuck Lorre by his birth name Chaim Levine and the uproar that caused. The purpose of these tactics is to shame the person based on his heritage, and I don't believe it's a particularly fair insult.\n\nPeople change their names for many reasons, such as making it easier to assimilate into another culture, to avoid confusion or misspelling.  Trump is a fair Anglicization of Drumpf, just as many Americans have.  \n\nWe can disagree with ideals without resorting to petty cultural jokes about a person's heritage. \n\n_____\n\n> *Hello, users of CMV!

            "selftext": "\"Pull yourself up by your bootstraps\". From Horatio Alger to Trump, and beyond, it holds a huge place in the popular imagination, particularly in the USA. It is often a key phrase used to describe a philosophical outlook which emphasises the individual person's responsibility to endeavour to work as hard as possible to further their cause, and succeed in their aims.\n\nInherent within the common use of the phrase is an idealogical attachment to the primacy of the indidual, over and against the \"state\", \"society\", or communality. It goes something like this: \"if you work hard, and pull yourself up by your own bootstraps, you'll succeed and be able to provide for yourself and those you love within your own lifetime\". It goes without saying that the idea is based on a success one could attain despite starting at the lowest eschelons of society, and touts social mobility and individual success in a competitive environment.\n\nI dont think Im being unfair. Im also not interested in having my view changed about authoritarianism vs Libertarianism, left vs right, socialism vs capitalism, or liberalism vs conservatism.\n\nTo change my view, you need to show me Im wrong on these points:\n\n1. Pulling yourself up by your own bootstraps is impossible. If my boots are on the ground, and I reach down and grab hold of the straps attached to them, I cannot succeed in pulling myself up. Whether \"up\" means to a more tall-and-straight standing position, or a geographic position physically above the ground, it is impossible for me to pull myself up by my bootstraps. However strong I am, no peraon could, ever. My feet will remain on the ground where they are, unless I lose my balance. I can pull all I want, but I will either break my boots, injure myself, or flat out fail.\n2. An outlook in terms of a narrative promoting individualism should not use this parable to defend its ideals, or means. This parable shows that an individual *can't* pull themselves up by their own bootstraps. That is the only specific lesson worth concluding from the parable. The only conclusion you could draw from a story about a person pulling themself up by their bootstraps, is that they were doomed to failure from the beginning, due to the impossible nature of their task. Individualism using this story to defend its economic and societal outlook is farcical.\n3. Assuming point 2, I come to these conclusions regarding those who use this parable to promote the view of the competence of the individual to overcome lowly start in terms of economic clout, social position, or disadvatagedness (Shut up, it should be a word!), yo come to substantial gain in those fields solely (or even as a great majority of total factors, which I dont think is unfair on the parable) by the expending of their own efforts, to elevate themself:\n\n3.1.That the speaker of the parable lacks critical awareness of the meaning and impossibility of their parable.\n3.2.That the speaker of the parable has certainly failed to understand that trying to use a parable based on an inherent impossibility, to defend a view - based on the parable - offering a distinct  inherent possibility, is farcical, and undermines their own position.\n3.3.Yhe speaker of the parable is promoting a view which will not require the hearers to engage in critical, reflective, thought, in order to believe what is being said, and even summarily defend it in turn, as an idea, despite lack of comprehension of its meaning, its impossibility, or its effect on ideas based on it.\n\nSo, please, I know that I am a smug society-believing European (I am British), and i know the parable and its use exist almost entirely within suspension of an environment (the USA) in which I have never lived, but please, CHANGE MY VIEW so that I dont continue to believe that everyone who uses this expression is a moron.\n\n_____\n\n> *Hello, users of CMV!

And it's making those people dig their heels in deeper.\n\nAll over Facebook, Twitter, Huffington Post and other places for political opinion, there are countless articles, written by liberals, who are borderline in shock at the level of support Donald Trump is receiving. There are articles apologizing on behalf of America to the rest of the world and articles bemoaning our situation and articles written from a place of bewilderment. It's like people can't wrap their heads around how our nation could possibly still be so racist and ignorant and intolerant.\n\nI believe the reason attacks against Trump have been unsuccessful is because his supporters have been mislabeled by liberals, the media, and the GOP.

He seems 100% right wing rhetoric with leftist policy when it comes to the issues. Hillary seems to be more for the free market and free trade then Trump and will not alienate our allies if she is elected.

            "selftext": "I should preface this by saying that this election has done nothing for my faith in the American electorate, but that is a separate point.\n\nWhat I mean to get at here is that, for several years now, we have all been hearing (and circlejerking) about how America has become an oligarchy ruled by unassailable special interests, where popular opinion either counts for nothing or can be easily bought.\n\nMy argument is that if this were true, the establishment would not have been able to lose control of this election to the extent that it has. Donald Trump has run roughshod over such establishment figures as Jeb Bush and Marco Rubio on a wave of popular support. Sanders has also gotten more votes than anyone expected.\n\nWhat all this has shown me is that all the media power and entrenched connections of the elite are not enough to stop a genuine wave of popular opinion. Yes, at present that wave of opinion is baying for the blood of foreigners and Muslims. But it is doing so through genuinely democratic channels, against everything the elite has tried to do to stop it. For better or worse, the reigns of power in America are still in the hands of the depressed, enraged, occasionally racist, electorate. Claiming that special interests hold the controlling interest in governance serves only to absolve voters of responsibility.\n\nTo change my view, you'll have to convince me that Trump's support is down to factors other than just anti-establishment sentiment and populism; i.e, show that the forces driving Trump forward are not as democratic as they appear. I'm using Trump as the main example here because it doesn't look at present like Sanders will win against Clinton, so his example doesn't make as strong an argument for the weakness of the establishment's practical control.\n\nWell, there we have it. I think this election has shown that the elites aren't nearly as 'in control' as we think, and that we as voters still hold a greater proportion of power than they do. CMV.\n\nPoint of clarification: I am not arguing that special interests don't hold too much power, merely that they don't hold enough power to be retain control in the face of organized public discontent at the ballot box.\n\n(Note: This post is not in any way, shape, or form, even tangentially, intended as an endosement of Donald Trump.)",

I mean if they drive down the prices that hospitals charge them, they would make a bigger profit.\n\n**Right to Healthcare:** If OC gets 100% coverage, isn't everyone getting access to healthcare anyway? So essentially no one is being \"deprived\" of their right to healthcare. OC works in practice to providing healthcare to everyone, even if not in principle.\n\nSo these are my questions:\n\n1. Why do we even need UH? Why is it so much superior that it calls for overhauling OC which is clearly working?\n\n2. How exactly will UH save more money than OC?\n\n3. How will Bernie pay for this? Surely taxing wallstreet derivatives, higher taxes on the rich (and cut military spending?) won't cover it? That's just like Trump saying he's gonna pay for everything by getting rid of EPA and board of education.\n\n4. How will he manage to get this passed in a majority republican house while at the same time, many democrats are funded by Insurance companies?\n\n5.

            "selftext": "To start, I'm assuming that this is a standard zombie apocalypse scenario, with near 100% infection. I'm also assuming that zombies can't swim/walk at the floor of the ocean, or if they can that they aren't smart enough to seek out humans this way.\n\nWith that out of the way, let me elaborate on my plan. I'll use myself as example. I live in Auckland, New Zealand and there is an island around 50 miles east of here called Great Barrier. It has arable land and a population of around 900. Either the island is untouched by the disease (best case scenario) or I am left to clear around 900 zombies. Ideally I'd aim to bring with me:\n\n* As much canned food & water as possible\n* A large arsenal of weaponry and ammo\n* Books, writing material\n* As many people as possible (men & women)\n* Sperm from sperm banks to prevent inbreeding\n* Infrastructure & tools (solar panels, nails, timber, steel, etc)\n* Seeds & possibly livestock\n\nWith as many of these things as possible I would boat to the island and establish a perimeter, slowly expanding until the entire island was clear of infection and self-sufficient. This may take several generations, and it may be a few more until the island reaches overpopulation. At that point it would become prudent to start considering expansion into other islands, slowly reclaiming land for humanity.\n\n**OPTIONAL READING: LONG TERM STRATEGY**\n\nAfro-Eurasia and the Americas are essentially lost, accounting for around 85% and 13% of world population respectively, leaving roughly 2% of the population remaining. Many other places can be written off as well, being either too high population density or too close to a continent to be safe (Manhattan being an excellent example of both). I'd estimate that colonising all potential islands would eventually result in attaining a maximum world population of ~100 million. At this point humanity could consider a more aggressive reclamation strategy involving Trump-style walls and military tier bombs, but that's thinking a little too far ahead.\n\nE: Someone commented but then deleted it. Just to clarify:\n\n* I don't think it's unreasonable to expect that zombies cannot swim, but even in a scenario where they can, the odd zombie wandering 50 miles off the coast isn't going to be an issue. \n\n* I likely won't get everything I listed as a target, they are only exactly what I said, targets.\n\n* This is not a safe plan, nor is it necessarily the best if you're being purely selfish. This is a plan to save humanity.\n\n_____\n\n> *Hello, users of CMV! This is a footnote from your moderators. We'd just like to remind you of a couple of things.

            "selftext": "This was originally posted in r/hillaryclinton but I got 0 responses. So... here I am I guess.\n\nHi guys, I'm not sure where else to post this so I came to her sub! Bernie supporter here who is going to be working my ass off to get him the nomination but let's assume for the sake of this post he doesn't. Hillary v. Trump come November and I cannot for the life of me decide if I will even vote in this election. I'm very active in the political process, I've been voting, donating, and canvassing for 18 years for candidates in local and national elections. I won't get into what I don't like about Hillary because from what I've seen you guys react very negatively to that. Instead let me just tell you what doesn't do it for me and what is important to me.\n**I refuse to vote for a candidate just because the other guy is worse. Full stop.** Please don't argue this point, If I shift towards the party instead of the party shifting towards me my views won't be represented.\n\nThe issues most important to me right now are Campaign finance reform, Military intervention, and Holding people accountable at the highest echelons of government/society.\n\n1. I feel like regarding the issue of finance reform Hillary and I have a lot of common ground but she's never pulled the trigger on actually making the change. And to be frank I think it's because the Clintons have been very very good at pulling this money into the Democratic party. What will make this year different, what encourages Dems this year compared to last to actually stand up and fight to get out from under the thumb of re-election money woes? Especially when they are currently winning that fight against the Republicans?\n\n2. We increased military spending by 800BN under Bush and continued it under Obama. Will Hillary turn this back to a realistic number? This is an absolutely crippling amount of spending that could be spent on our infrastructure and cleaning up the country. In addition Obama's drone strike policies have been absolutely horrifying to me, is Clinton really going to continue this same middle-east policy? How will she differ from Obama? This is the scariest point to me... I honestly can't get over the sheer horror of what we've done and continue to do since 2000 and had hoped we would have changed our stance when we got Obama into office.\n\n3. Accountability for bad actors. This cannot be said enough, we do not hold our bad actors accountable. Hillary's position seems to be pass legislation that allows us to. Historically... this hasn't been the case. We have repeatedly and systematically protected our senators, congressmen, ceos and otherwise affluent people from the actions of their wrongdoing. I work in an industry that is affiliated with the Insurance/Finance industry(Hillary's so called shadow banking) and I routinely see bad actions from our clients that are already breaking existing statues and guidelines. You know what happens when you fail these audits or get caught breaking these laws? You pay a fine. There is already jail time associated with these actions but it's never pursued. It's a cost of doing business in this world, not a risk of jail. No one cares about Frank-Dodd, I don't know if Frank-Dodd is her soundbite or her position but it's 100% toothless if it's her position. It's important to me because from my point of view, there are always going to be bad actors, and unless we follow through with serious jail-time we will continue to behave in the way that makes us the most money at he cost of everyone else.\n\nSorry for the long post, please don't attack my Sanders support or try to convince me that Trump is a scary monster (even if you think he is). I am really just looking for the reasons to vote FOR her in November not against Trump. If that's how I voted I would vote Vermin Supreme over Trump. Appreciate all of the feedback I get and good luck to everyone in November.\n\n_____\n\n> *Hello, users of CMV! This is a footnote from your moderators.

            "selftext": "I live in Michigan and our primary is today. You have 5 hours to convince me which one to cast my vote for today. Go!\n\n**EDIT:** Michigan is an Open Primary, so I can vote in either party's primary.\n\nHere are some areas that are important to me. Convince me that your favored candidate best lines up with my views, or that voting for your candidate would do the least damage to the areas I think are most important.\n\n* War: I fall into the non-interventionist camp. I would be in favor of bringing our military home and not being the world's police. I also support Colin Powell's \"You break it, you buy it\" policy on foreign wars. IF we go in, we fix the mess we make.\n* Environment: We need to protect our environment and natural resources, especially water and air.\n* Energy: We need to become more energy independent, even if that means more domestic oil production until cost-effective renewable energy can be developed.\n* Education: Education needs a major revamp. More centralization, less bureaucracy. Common Core is a good thing. More funding needs to go towards education. Teachers should be paid more and/or more teachers should be hired to reduce class sizes.\n* Economy: Free Market is preferred as long as everyone is playing by the rules (ie: some regulations, but not excessive).\n* Taxes: I am middle class and I want lower taxes. I want to have more money from paychecks that I can both save and spend. Spending money empowers the economy.\n* **EDIT:** Corporate Tax: I believe the corporate tax rate needs to be lower to make us more competitive with the rest of the world.\n* National Debt/Spending: I want spending to be reduced so we can take care of the deficits/debt.\n* Immigration: I'm in favor of easier legal immigration. Unless you are native american, you are the product of immigration of some kind.\n* Terrorism: The majority of terrorism we have faced is blowback directly from our policies in the Middle East. We helped create and arm Al-Qaeda and ISIS. We directly inspired the Iranian Revolution and enabled the current state of Iran. We propped up leaders like Saddam Hussein and Gaddafi until they were no longer useful, then collapsed their nations into decades of chaos. We need to get out of the ME and stop intervening in other nation's affairs. Muslim =/= terrorist and anyone who infers that is an unamerican bigot.\n* Entitlements: I like Frank Underwood. \"You are entitled to nothing.\" I also like the idea behind House of Cards' \"AmericaWorks\" program. I think social security and the like are good things, but are broken and need to be fixed (ie: significantly reformed or replaced, not just given more money).\n\nIf there are any other specific views you'd like to know, please ask.\n\nThere you go. Please Change My View.\n\n**EDIT: Result (a bit earlier than I expected, but wife is off work early, so we're voting soon): I'll either vote for Kasich or Sanders. Everyone is distasteful to me and I find these 2 the least distasteful of those left. Kasich has the edge because he is closer to overtaking Trump than Sanders is to overtaking Clinton. I'll decide between the two at the last second at the poll.**\n\n**NOTE: Neither Kasich nor Sanders would likely get my vote in the General Election either way. This is just my way of using my vote to exercise some power into getting the least worst candidate (imo) for the sheeple to vote for in the general (that is said tongue in cheek).**\n_____\n\n> *Hello, users of CMV!

            "selftext": "Donald Trump was quoted in 1998 if he were to run for president he would run as a republican saying they're the \"dumbest group of voters\". This struck me as interesting especially since he's been a democrat before.\n\nHe also has been heavily critisized for defending planned parenthood and also won't release his conversation with the New York Times about immigration which leads me to believe he doesn't actually want to build a wall he's just saying that because that's what the \"dumb\" voters want. \n\nThis makes me think that he won't be thaat bad if he gets elected because he doesn't say what he won't do anything that he's saying he will and will probably destroy the republican party to a point where they might have to separate themselves entirely from the people who voted for Trump.\n\n_____\n\n> *Hello, users of CMV!

I'd identify as an Independent if it wasn't meaningless with the current system. So I identify as nothing. I vote and support both Democrats and Republics. I support Senator Sanders and he's my top choice out of all of the current candidates. I don't consider myself an adamant supporter of his views. I don't know enough about healthcare systems to have a significant view on the best way to deal with healthcare, so I have no positive or negative opinions about his healthcare policies. I dislike his views on space and energy. His views and policies as President make their primary impact through bills he can influence and push through congress. So ultimately his personal views don't mean that much if they can only be drafted by a congressman. I primarily like him because of his honestly and integrity -- he seems genuine. \n\nThis gets to the interesting bit. I have a lot of trouble trusting Clinton. I agree with more of her political views than I do Sanders, but she feels very dishonest. I trust Trump more than her. Yes, he's insensitive and blunt, but many of his views are fairly moderate. With Trump it's the same case as Sanders: his more extreme ideas still have to make it though a Congress. At least having Trump as president will help to shake up the atmosphere of the Presidency. I like the idea of non-politicians holding elected office and Trump could serve to set the precedent of entrepreneurs in office. However, I feel dirty thinking that in the hypothetical event that it was a Clinton v Trump ticket, I would vote for Trump.\n\n_____\n\n> *Hello, users of CMV!

With 4 republican candidates, a candidate could take all the delegates available from a state by winning barely more than 25% of the vote. As a result, the delegates would go to that candidate against the vote of nearly 75% of the state.

However, if he gets 35% of the vote in a W-T-A state, he gets all the delegates from a state he couldn't win if multiple opponents weren't splitting the remaining 65% of the vote.\n\nUnless there are only two candidates, in which case the state clearly picks one over the other, or one candidate wins over 50% of the vote, in which case (s)he would carry the state even if all the other votes were consolidated in a single opponent, a state's delegtes should be awarded proportionally.\n\nSome notes: I'm not suggesting either of these should necessarily mandate that a state become W-T-A, just that it would be justifiable with those conditions. I'm also open to some level of weighted delegate awarding (as opposed to strictly proportional) in cases where a candidate get significantly close to 50 % and/or wins by a very large margin.\n\n_____\n\n> *Hello, users of CMV!

            "selftext": "First off, I do not condone making a tense political season more tense by crashing political rallies.  Opposition protesters should do their best to remain in areas where they will have a clear avenue of retreat and can remain in a bloc.  Inside an arena is not such a space and if violence or panic begins, crowd movements can easily trap and injure or kill people. \n\nAll over Reddit and in other venues last night, Trump supporters were accusing Sanders supporters of suppression of free speech.  But what is suppression of free speech?  In the US, the 1st Amendment states that\" \"Congress shall make no law... abridging the freedom of speech.\"  Bearing in mind that there was no law made to prevent Trump from speaking at his rally, I will immediately concede the point that free speech is enshrined as a right in the US and people should generally not be prevented from speaking their minds, by legal or other means.\n\nSo did the protesters prevent Trump from speaking his mind, at one time at one particular venue?\n\nNo.\n\nThen simply wanted to speak their minds as well.  This is a celebration of free speech; not its suppression.  The presence of boisterous, but peaceful, demonstrators is not suppression of free speech.  Trump and his supporters are trying to spin this incident as something it isn't.  In the absence of a concrete threat, the presence in the same venue of a large group of people who are simply expressing disagreement with you does not, ever, suppress your free speech.\n\nTrump's postponement of the rally was his own decision.   According to [the Chicago Tribune](http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/ct-illinois-2016-primary-election-st-pats-parade-met-0313-20160311-story.html) the Chicago Police did not ask the rally be postponed. Therefore it was a freely made decision on Trump's part.  I will not speculate on the reasons for that decision here; however being a freely made decision, it was also an expression of Trump's freedom of speech.  The freedom not to speak, or to speak at another time or place, is inextricable from the right to speak freely.\n\nIn conclusion, while Friday's events in Chicago might be deplorable, no one's right to free speech was suppressed and those who claim otherwise should reevaluate both the actual events and their understanding of free speech.\n",

And particularly in trump's case it's not hard to see that one of the big emotional motivators for his support is as a backlash against the perception that the modern left is overbearing and stifling. \n\nIf you dislike trump I'd say the most sensible course of action is to just vote against him, or campaign for his opponent,  but I don't see how taking it to the streets does anything except be a fun day out for those who like marching and shouting \n\ne; I've tried to award some deltas but they dont seem to be registering.\n_____\n\n> *Hello, users of CMV!

            "selftext": "Elections give us a hope for the future, a good vision to support. But all of the promises and headlines really don't mean anything. The single most important job of the president is to lead congress and negotiate internationally. If you hate Wall Street and all the corruption in the system, voting for Bernie or trump is not going to do anything. If you want to change that, you're going to have to start voting in the right state reps. \n\nBoth Bernie and trump have absolutely no plan on foreign policy, let alone any experience whatsoever. Trump would be an utter disaster and Bernie would just be winging it. Hillary on the other hand, has experience. Whether or not she has messed up certain foreign policy issues doesn't really concern me. She is level headed and is a proven negotiator internationally.\n\nMany people forget that the U.S. Is just another player in the game. While we are certainly one of the biggest, it doesn't mean that the others such as Russia, China and Germany are any less significant. I believe trump would be a horrible representation of the country. While I believe he would be a lot better than trump, bernie would not be nearly as good as a representation of the country to the rest of the world.\n\nOn top of the main points above, to change my view, you need to convince me that voting in Bernie or trump would change the system. In my opinion, the president has a lot less power domestically than the lay person thinks. I don't think Bernie or trump have any chance of changing the system, even a little. \n\n\n\n",

            "selftext": "First, let me provide a little bit of context as to where this thought comes from. I am a Bernie supporter, and while I'm still holding out hope, I recognize the likelihood that Hillary Clinton will be the democratic nominee. Meanwhile, Trump is rising seemingly by the day over on the Republican end. Now, this could only be a regional thing, though I've seen the sentiment echoed online as well--but many, many people who I interact with on a day to day basis see Trump as an unfortunate \"lesser of two evils\" in a matchup against Hilary. I don't share this view, but I've been hearing it in just about every discussion I've had pertaining to the election lately. \"It can't be worse than Trump unless it's Hillary,\" \"I'd only vote Trump if it came down to him and Hillary,\" etc. This notion terrifies me, but it does lead me to another point: Trump is not the Republican favorite of any of these people, either. Nearly every republican I know supports Ted Cruz, who looks to be rapidly approaching the status of Trump's only contender for the nomination. \n\nAt first, I wanted to root for Cruz getting the Republican nomination. While I knew that he wasn't an ideal choice, I assumed that he would be a safer alternative than the Donald. But then I looked into his platform, and now I'm not so sure.\n\nA few points that stood out to me:\n-Ending corporate income tax\n-Denying subsidies for producers of renewable energy \n-His immigration policy is basically \"Trump with less shouting.\"\n-Against net neutrality\n-Stances on social issues are a nightmare \n-The same ridiculous \"flat tax\" that everyone ripped on Carsen for \n-Opposed to protections on ocean, coastal and Great Lakes ecosystems \n-Everything regarding the Middle East. \n\nI could go on and on, but you get the point: pretty typical far-right fare. However, Cruz takes it a step further with fanatical religious rhetoric akin to people like Huckabee and Santorum. Cruz religiously fueled manifest-destiny attitude terrifies me--we have a separation of church and state for a reason, and fanaticism combined with power is, historically, not awesome. I feel that it Trump weren't in this race, then Cruz would be the one everyone considered a crazy extremist. Trump's outlandishness has had a ripple effect of making other extremists look moderate by comparison.\n\nWhich brings us to the tip of all this: the Cruz vs. Trump argument. Yes, Trump's rhetoric is just as backwards and insane as Cruz's, often worse, but the key difference is that Trump doesn't seem to have any ACTUAL plans. His entire \"platform\" is reliant on buzzwords, blanket statements, and pandering to his base--no substance, no actual plans or policies, which, in any other case, is a bad thing. But Cruz seems to HAVE plans. He knows what he's going to do and has at least some idea of how he'll do it. And I don't think that anything good could come of that.\n\nTrump, meanwhile, has no idea what he's doing. He's politically and economically incompetent, and likely would struggle to make anything happen legislatively speaking. In addition, he has a rather wishy-washy history, certainly none of the hardline convictions that drive Cruz. While I've hesitated to make these sorts of statements about Trump up until now, the fact is that we still can't be entirely certain WHAT he believes, as a whole. There are grey areas, though at the very least I can agree with some of the stances he seems to have held in the past. And he feeds off of his popularity right now, but celebrity is fickle--he doesn't have the same unshakable \"moral\" convictions that drive Ted Cruz. While I hold no illusions that Donald Trump would be easy for anyone to work with, his \"convictions,\" if you can even call them that, stem from a much more transient, negotiable place than Cruz's fire-and-brimstone religious extremism.\n\nWhat it boils down to is that, under a Donald Trump presidency, there is some ambiguity as to what might happen. But we can KNOW that a Ted Cruz presidency would be disastrous. \n\nSo, people of Reddit, change my view. ",

            "selftext": "Trump is not an idiot, and anticipated that a rally in the heart of liberal downtown Chicago would generate massive protests. If he wanted a peaceful rally with massive turnout by his supporters, he would have easily booked something in Chicago's western suburbs or downstate Illinois. \n\nTrump knew that the protests would likely be large and chaotic enough to  postpone the event due to \"safety reasons\", and it'd be reasonable to say that if that happened, this thing would be massively newsworthy. I mean, when was the last time a Rubio or Hillary Rally was the #1 trending item on Facebook? \n\nSo, it's in my opinion that everything that occurred was anticipated by Trump, and that the whole thing was designed to get his name is all over the news for 2-3 days. And to top it off, a lot of his opposition is being portrayed as \"violent and unruly\" thanks to the pictures of police with bloody heads, etc. It was a total win for him. \n\nThis event was just a big media blitz, by a man who certainly knows how to capture the headlines. \n\nCMV. \n\n_____\n\n> *Hello, users of CMV!

            "selftext": "As stated, I\u2019m a libertarian, so I won\u2019t find any major politicians even close to my point of view. To gain a delta, I could see someone convincing me any of the following things:\n\n1: Voting for a lesser evil is worthwhile. \n\n2: Voting for the Libertarian Party will somehow advance the cause of liberty. \n\n3: My vote for Hillary or Trump would make a difference in the outcome of the vote and since both are hated, they\u2019d likely be able to get very little done in office and gridlock would occur. \nYou can keep the above in mind before I discuss my points. \n\n4: I should vote just because of the initiatives for my local community since my vote matters there. \n\nMoments of major importance in the history of liberty rarely come from political action, but from the market. It was not the unions that allowed us to live beyond an awful life of 12 hour days in a factory, but the increased productive ability of each individual at the factory when new technology came along. \n\nThe future of liberty follows the same path. Automation will replace many jobs and the economy will transform again to new sectors that few people know of today. What 1850s farmer could have believed that in only a couple lifetimes only two percent of the US population would work on a farm? Even an educated individual could not foresee the massive changes the makeup of the american economy. I believe that encryption and other technological advances will hinder the ability of the government to enact its will upon the people and black markets will continue to thrive at an accelerating rate. The Silk Road is one example, even if the government eventually took it down, but more will pop up. And hopefully for more beneficial markets than drugs, like human organs.\n\nI see the above, and other forms of agorism, as the only way liberty will advance in the coming years. I don\u2019t think democratic means will ever help the cause of liberty for a few reasons: \n\n1: There is an inequality of incentives inherent in a democracy. [This video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vn6G3lS9k1E) gives a good concise explanation of why laws are passed that benefit only the rich and well connected. And this has been happening much longer than the Citizens United case, so overturning that would do no good. By having a concentrated monopoly on law, powerful interests will always collude for their benefit at the expense of others. \n\n2: Seeing which policies do and do not work has very little effect on the political views of most people. In general, when people need to make decisions about something, they are most rational and devote the most time to the decision when it affects them the most. Politics is not one of these situations. [People are irrational about politics](http://www.owl232.net/irrationality.htm) and for good reason. Even though americans have seen that alcohol prohibition didn\u2019t work, they cannot make the connection to marijuana, or other drugs. \n\n3: Democracies have a tendency to lean populist. Politicians can become popular by adhering to a nation\u2019s fear of foreigners and other irrationalities that are unlikely to change. So we get people like Donald Trump and Bernie Sanders who want to have massively protectionist economic policies, even though protectionism is harmful to the nation. Need I mention the wall? The point here is that populism is the natural direction of democracy and totally opposed to liberty. \n\nIt\u2019s probably clear by now that I don\u2019t believe we should have a democracy. What we should have is another discussion, but I\u2019d be in favor of some form of anarchy, even if it devolves into city-states. Nonetheless, I see only six major ways to try to advance liberty:\n\n1: *Violent revolution*\n\nThis will not work. When a revolution occurs, the security of the average citizen is threatened, so they\u2019re more willing to give up more liberty so the violence may stop. \n\n2: *Secession*\n\nI\u2019m definitely in favor of this because it will decentralize power, even if only by a small amount. There is the argument that it will hurt free trade, which is valid, but overall I will favor something more decentralized. If my ballot included a measure for secession, I\u2019d go vote. \n\n3: *Engagement in the Political Process*\n\nI don\u2019t think this is very worthwhile. Sure, Ron Paul got many people interested in liberty, but I don\u2019t believe that liberty need be a \u201cbig tent movement\u201d. The advances are rarely caused by many people arguing for it on ideological grounds, or even practical ones. \n\n4: *Education of Peers*\n\nI\u2019m mixed here. I don\u2019t think it would do too much because of political irrationality, but for people who are willing to hold an argument it\u2019s worth a shot. \n\n5: *Agorism*\n\nThis, I believe, is the most effective way to advance liberty. Through technological advances, especially in the digital realm, the power of the state can be diminished. \n\n6: *Sea-Steading/Creating New Nations*\n\nI don\u2019t think this is worthy today, but maybe in the future. Not a lot of decent land isn\u2019t under control by a central government anymore, and seasteading would have high costs for average people to start it today. \n\nI made the above list to avoid the counter argument of \u201cIf you don\u2019t vote, you\u2019re not doing anything/nothing will be done\u201d. Advances will likely be made outside of the political process. And I intend to participate in these. I\u2019m studying statistics and computer science and hope to be able to work in some sort of agorist business some day. \n\nI feel I\u2019ve outlined 1) why democracy as a whole won\u2019t help liberty and 2) ways that liberty will be advanced. But I haven\u2019t gotten to why my vote wouldn\u2019t make a difference. For that, I\u2019ll refer to the four main arguments that I could be convinced of that I laid out at the top. \n\n1: Voting for lesser of two evils is worthwhile. It\u2019s still evil. Sure it may be less bad, but suppose I were captured by a murderous group of people and asked how I wanted to die, lethal injection or electrocution. I would not be concerned with my decision there because I would be looking for other ways to escape the situation. The same reasoning applies to voting. \n\n2: The Libertarian Party. It seems like it\u2019s always going to be a useless venture for the LP. They are terrible at packaging themselves for the general public and will never amount to more than a few percent. Maybe I\u2019d give them a vote if they chose a candidate that was able to bring in people from both the left and right, but none of the current candidates could do that. And again, voters will tend toward populism, which the LP can\u2019t really represent, so I don\u2019t think they\u2019ll ever be able to gain traction or make significant moves. One could argue that by increasing their voter base, major party candidates would have to pander to the LP to get their vote, but to do so would alienate a lot of their base, so I doubt it\u2019d be effective. \n\n3: Hillary/Trump and gridlock. This is probably the best argument one could give. Since the president has the most power in the government, and all the candidates are awful, I should vote for the ones least likely to accomplish their goals, or any goals at all. I think Trump probably fits this best. Both parties hate him and would stop many of his motions. I\u2019d also expect Trump to use his veto power more often than average, so when congress does get together to do something (usually bad for liberty) it can be stopped by Trump. I guess my best argument against this is that if I\u2019m voting for a major candidate, then my vote almost certainly won\u2019t be the one to make a difference. Hell, it\u2019s a practical certainty. It also doesn\u2019t sit right with me to vote for such a vile person, since a vote implies support. \n\n4: Local election nonsense. I come from a smaller than average town of about 7000. They\u2019re all democratic socialists and any libertarian vote would be lost. Also, as a college student, I own no property there, so I haven\u2019t learned about what measures are designed for what purposes. I never plan on being there for more than a week at a time in the future, so I don\u2019t consider myself its citizen. And I\u2019d feel wrong to enforce my view upon others. Also, my voice would still never make a difference even if the support for something was roughly 50%. Or at least the probability of all votes other than me being perfectly split is extremely small. \n\nSo convince me otherwise. Even other anarchists vote when the election rolls around, so maybe I should as well. \n_____\n\n> *Hello, users of CMV! This is a footnote from your moderators.

            "selftext": "Hello. So my current predicament is that I support Donald Trump for our next POTUS. There is a lot of inflammatory rhetoric going on this election, and while my views on him have been pretty solid these last few months, I am now growing increasingly anxious about the nature of his campaign and what he means for this country. This is not an invitation for you to call me a bigot or racist. I am neither, and have already lost a good friend because he is a staunch Bernie supporter.\n\n1.) I believe that Trump is a strong figurehead for our nation, and provides excellent negotiating tactics, which will be required in the current geopolitical climate. Situations such as the Iran Deal, or the European Migrant Crisis further my belief that we need to be strong and tough in dealing with foreign powers that would either attack us, or exploit our nation's many benefits and opportunities.\n\n2.) I believe in immigration reform. I do not support the \"wall\" that is often brought up as a laughingstock of the campaign. It is an intangible, dangerous, almost cartoonish manner of dealing with the border problem. That being said, I support the improvement of our homeland security system. The cartels threaten the southern US, and the safety of our citizens living in those areas. Our prison population is somewhere near 27% of illegal aliens, and as we all know, the U.S.' correctional system is a major drain on taxpayer money. As an end note on this topic, I support the deportation of **all** illegal immigrants. Nothing personal, you just didn't get here legally.\n\n3.) The violence at his rallies has been unsettling, and I do not support his removal of protesters, but after the Chicago riot, I no longer really care. Bernie goes on record saying Trump is responsible for the violence that occurred, totally ignoring that he praised the protesters that stormed the Trump rally, and then saying in an interview that he can't go around taking responsibility for his followers. This seems wrong to me. That being said, the rally was a private event. You need to get tickets in order to attend, and I would expect a certain level of behavior is acceptable. I have seen plenty of videos and images where the \"oppressed parties\" openly antagonized those who would later molest them.\n\nTL;DR: Anti-Trump supporters far too often kick the beehive and cry about it later.\n\n4a.) The only thing I disagree with him on, economically speaking, is lowering our defense budget. I have family in the military who espouse frustration with not only a lack of equipment and funding to their respective branches, but also in that long-term career soldiers are being kicked out on technicalities and previously overlooked medical conditions in order to avoid pension and benefit costs. \n\n4b.) Returning to the point that I made about our correctional system, my father is a correctional officer in a minimum security prison. The state has been good for us, and we benefited from his employment by receiving health insurance throughout my youth. I no longer am on his plan, and pay for my own insurance through my company. \n\n4c.) My mother's side of the family ran a small local business for several years. They'd been the victims of imminent domain twice, losing their family farm once, nearly a century ago, and again sometime in the last 40 years when highway construction forced their business off of their own personal property, as well as some other property that could have been sold to a private party for greater benefit to us, instead of to the government for a relative pittance. We have since closed the business, and my family now works menial labor jobs to make ends meet. My mother currently makes less than I do, and I am a warehouse worker just above minimum wage.  \n\n5.) The racist bit. Everywhere I go I hear about how \"racist\" Donald is in his rhetoric and action. I am not here to defend him on this end, because I frankly do not care how he is perceived as his own personal being. Here is what I think:\n\n*We are losing a lot of money to Mexico in both trade and the actions of illegal immigrants. The same is true for China, concerning trade that is. Calling \"racist\" for wanting to halt illegal immigration is not racist. It means that we want to make a smart economic decision. Mexico is experiencing some ugly things right now, but that is not our responsibility. We are not beholden to these people.\n\n*On the subject of the \"syrian refugees\", I do not believe we should take any of them, at all. If we do, we need to screen for their best and brightest- doctors, scientists, etc.- but nobody else. Once again, it is not our problem. I believe that accepting a large number of these migrants will result in activities similar to those perpetrated by the couple in San Bernardino, and family that I have in law enforcement tell me that there are growing numbers of Americans attempting to contact ISIS via the internet. Once again, this is a safety concern. One cannot be racist towards muslims because Islam is a religion. If a religion were manipulated to threaten harm upon my country I would oppose it, no matter what it was, or from where it hailed. It just happens to be Islam at this current time.\n\nGo ahead and a call me a bigot now.\n\n_____\n\n> *Hello, users of CMV! This is a footnote from your moderators.

None of which has anything to do with lowering the national debt.\n\n[most graphs](http://mercatus.org/sites/default/files/debt-limit-history-data-for-web-2013-updated-rjr-chart1%20large.jpg) on google images depict the national debt up to around 2010-2011 when it was a talking point because of having the raise the debt ceiling.\n\nNow.. nothing, its like a distant memory. Like a cancer patient told he has a few years left instead of a few months, he would be relieved. The cancer is still there though.\n\nI was having a read through [this](https://np.reddit.com/r/China/comments/49xxpg/problems_with_bank_of_china_accounts_and/d0vt1ga?context=3) Bestof post and it got me thinking.\n\nIs he right? could the Chinese banks collapse if they don't adhere to Americas insane demands? or would China just make a call on America and send it down into a hole. \n\nAmerican elections meanwhile talk about spending instead of saving. \n\nWhen I was 21 I got my first bigboy job. I took out a car loan for a luxury car, got a credit card and went crazy, now at the age of 26 I earn much more but have much less than I did at 21. Half my pay goes to loans, then after rent and bills I can barely afford to see a movie.\n\nTrumps slogan \"Make America Great Again\" confuses the shit out of me, when was it great? when government borrowing ran rampart? sure I had a great year at 21, but I'm paying for it now, much like the American economy is paying for it today. Does that mean the day I pay off my debt that I'll get another car loan and credit card? fuck, no. \n\nNo politician in America is willing to push the country exactly where it needs to go to become better, because it means that while they hold office America will have to go without. Then people won't vote for them.\n\nThere is a huge problem, no one is fixing it, no one is talking about fixing it and everyone thinks everything is fine and fucking dandy when America is not far off being where Greece is\n_____\n\n> *Hello, users of CMV!

And in the primaries on the Republican side, Trump is honestly looking like the front-runner.\n\nI think that the reasons that I can't vote for Trump are obvious. I will fully admit that I wrote him in during the 2008 elections because that was another presidential race where I didn't like either candidate and Trump had yet to prove (to me) what a colossally bad choice he would be.\n\nI still have beef with Hillary Clinton over her whole \"Videogames are making this country violent\" thing from the 90s and 2000s. Something so obviously wrong and something that was basically a crusade started by professional lunatic and vexatious litigant Jack Thompson, I just can't forgive that, despite the parts of her policy I agree with.\n\nI considered moving to Canada, but upon further reflection I would have to mock myself so hard I'd burst into flames if I did this.\n\nSo the only option left is to try to shake things up in the American political system. [5 percent of the popular vote qualifies a third party for a government grant that will put them on somewhat-equal financial footing with the big 2](http://ivn.us/2012/11/01/why-5-matters-to-gary-johnson/) and come next election cycle it's going to be much *more* interesting.\n\nI say Libertarian because I agree with them the most on social issues; I've drifted away from them on economic policy, but I do think that many of their social policies (ie: stop imprisoning non-violent drug users and let the ones who are currently in jail free) will help the economy, so that mitigates things.\n\nSome things that probably won't change my view:\n\n* Challenging my currently-held political beliefs that make me think Libertarians are my best bet (I agree with Libertarians almost entirely when it comes to social issues, but align more Democrat for economic issues)\n\n* Trying to convince me that Trump or Hilary aren't that bad. I know that I agree with Hilary's stances on a lot of things, but I still don't trust her at all, and that's important. I don't agree with Trump on anything.\n\nSome things that might be the best avenue for a view change:\n\n* A different third party who has a chance at getting 5% and aligns more closely with my views.\n\nAs a quick rundown on social issues: I believe that people should be free to do what they want up until it infringes on the rights of others directly. I believe that victimless crimes should not be crimes. I believe that there's no reason that gays should not be able to both marry, and be able to carry a firearm, just so I get in something that gets both sides riled up.\n\nOn economic issues: I believe that wealth inequality needs to be addressed, and the free market fails to do this. I believe that once something has become both 1) ubiquitous enough and 2) a necessity for modern life, it should be made a public service or utility (healthcare, internet, etc;). I believe that the government should exist to make sure that companies and other people don't infringe on the rights of others, with bad business practices and the like.\n_____\n\n> *Hello, users of CMV!

            "selftext": "Both Clinton and Trump seem like bad people to vote for when it comes to being the President of the United States.\n\nHillary seems like a corporate pawn. She's taken so much money from all sorts of places, it's hard to believe she wouldn't have their interests in mind. I can't get behind that. Also, the way she talks and acts seems very like, \"I'll say and do anything if it means getting elected.\" I think she tries really hard to be perceived as cool or something. When I listen to her talk there's just something very disingenuous about it. I'm not even sure I can trust her stances on most things. To me, she's just not likable or trustworthy at all.\n\nTrump seems like an all around terrible person. The way he talks and acts doesn't seems like the way a President should talk and act. His immigration policies seem extreme. I think he has Trump's interests in mind first over the country's. Also, since Trump is a business mogul, would he really just walk away from everything to be President? I'm pretty sure he'd be dividing his time between his empire and his presidency, which doesn't seem like a good thing.\n\nI can't find any good reason to vote for either of these people.\n_____\n\n> *Hello, users of CMV!

            "selftext": "Recently I've been hearing a lot of bemoaning of unfair treatment of Bernie Sanders or Donald Trump or insert whatever candidate you wish by the mainstream media.  So the refrain goes, the media misrepresents his/her policies and only highlights negative events of the campaign instead of focusing on the \"real\" message and the \"true\" enthusiasm of the base, if the media even covers said candidate at all.\n\n\nThis grumble is a possibly effective tactic by a manipulative candidate bit silly if said by an average supporter.  What people are really saying is, \"The candidate I support is not even effective enough to navigate a salacious and often hostile media, already showing his/her weakness as a candidate since a part of a politicians job is to persuade people regardless of those that aren't towing the talking points line.\"  They're basically saying their candidate isn't that great if a politician.\n\n\nIn addition, this same grumble about the media has been used by virtually every candidate, with the most whining coming when candidates have dramatic ground to make up.  \"The media refuses to acknowledge how well Rand Paul is doing.\" \"They refuse to talk about the groundswell around Ron Paul.\"  \"The mainstream media just hates Howard Dean.\"  \"The media is openly lying about Ralph Nader's actual positions.\"  Patrick Buchanan, Bill Bradley, Ronald Reagan even.  The list is long of the whiners.  Yet effective candidates have always overcome this issue.  Acting incredulous when a candidate doesn't overcome it, then, just makes one look like a sore loser.\n\n\nAgain, I fully recognize blaming the media as a legitimate political tactic to rile up support, and I might even support its use at times: but political supporters often believe the hype on it and are really just reduced to saying \"Politics is hard and my candidate just couldn't hack it.\"",

            "selftext": "Why does person A decide to pursue a platonic or sexual relationship with person B? Usually because person B has a set of qualities that person A finds desirable. Opposite of that is the set of hypothetical qualities of person B that would be most beneficial to person A in a relationship.\n\nThe main reason for why platonic or sexual relationships might end up having more negative than positive consequences for the individual is a lack of correlation between desired and beneficial qualities, which in the majority of the cases is due to \n\n* mistakenly identifying non-beneficial qualities as relevant and beneficial and therefore desirable, or\n\n* mistakenly identifying beneficial qualities as irrelevant or non-beneficial and therefore non-desirable.\n\nFrom my point of view some examples of the former are physical appearance, wealth (past a given point), propensity for violence and of the latter tranquility, reliability, compassion.\n\nI don't count qualities like trustworthiness or selfishness directly since no one would define them as undesirable or desirable respectively. The importance here is that some other qualities might have implications on these qualities that a person might disregard; a lack of reliability can also be a sign of a lack of trustworthiness, a lack of compassion is a sign of selfishness.\n\nSome empirical evidence that supports my view:\n\n* [40-50% of all first marriages](http://www.divorce.usu.edu/files/uploads/lesson3.pdf) in the US will end in a divorce. The reason in almost all cases is the fact that at least one partner misidentified the qualities of the other partner, whether it is the amount of commitment, selflessness, fidelity, maturity or anything else.\n\n* [4/5 of rapes in the US](https://rainn.org/statistics) are committed by someone known to the victim, 47% are committed by a friend or acquaintance. (I want to make *explicitly clear* that I am **not** putting a generic moral responsibility on the victim. See note at the bottom.) A person who will commit a rape-crime can only gain the friendship of the victim if she mistakenly identifies him as trustworthy.\n\n* Misreading the personality of politicians: [The latest poll](https://today.yougov.com/news/2016/03/14/trump-rises-national-support-rubio-falls-and-carso/) shows that Trump has an approval rating of more than 50% compared to Cruz, Kasich and Rubio. On the other side, [Clinton](http://edition.cnn.com/election/primaries/parties/democrat) now has roughly twice as much delegates as Sanders and will likely end up the democratic nominee. If I didn't know either of them and listened to their supporters talking about the other candidate, I'd think that both of them are mad-ass villains trying to destroy the US. Now, both sides can't be right, which means at least one side is grossly misidentifying a political candidate to have qualities beneficial or detrimental to the US.\n\nI believe that it is not a Herculean task to correctly identify the qualities of a person with respect to a possible platonic or sexual relationship (or an election for that matter), after spending some time with him/ her. So far I never had major problems with trusting or investing in the wrong people, and I plan to keep it that way. I also believe that in many cases a misidentification of a quality can be prevented by focusing less on how much short-term profit a relationship with a person having that quality would have on my own life.\n\n**About victim blaming** (if you care to read this): A girl in her 20s who I know well has been going through a hard time for a couple of years now, and last year started sending a very questionable man in his 40s nude pictures of herself in exchange for cigarettes, money and attention. It was very evident that being around him was not a good idea, even dangerous, which I told her, but she disregarded it. Earlier this year I found out that in her own words she had been drugged while at his place and sexually assaulted and raped. I am giving this example to show that in some cases the victim *does* have a part of the responsibility for what happened, namely she could have prevented it, if she had better identified him as the actual devious criminal person he is. To clarify this: I do not generalize *all* or even a majority of the victims of a rape crime to be even similar to this case, but I don't exclude the possibility that a given case *is* similar. As for the perpetrator: He should be prosecuted no matter what the victim did before. A rape is still a rape and should be treated as such.\n\n_____\n\n> *Hello, users of CMV!

I don't follow politics that closely, but I do check on the news fairly often, and it seems that policy is almost never a topic when it pertains to the Republican party, and instead the focus always seems to be on the latest stupid thing that Trump has *said*.  It seems like the controversy is never about his actual policy prescriptions.  \n\nI contrast this with the Democratic side, where the news seems to be about Hilary's inconsistent stances on certain policies, and reactions to Bernie's socialist ideas.  Both of these topics relate to actual policy differences, although rhetoric does come into play as well (particularly because of the potency of the word \"socialism\").\n\nSo does anyone want to talk about how different Trump's actual policy platform differs from the other candidates, or how the internal relationships within the Republican party differ from those on the Democratic side?",

            "selftext": "In this presidential election cycle, the role of anti-establishment politics has become increasingly prominent. The anomalously high support for 'outsider' candidates like Trump and Sanders reflects a growing sentiment that American politics is failing and that it is time to overthrow worn-out establishment forces. Both candidates talk explicitly about the establishment, how they do not belong to it, and why that means they are a good candidate. On reddit this sentiment is particularly strong and it is telling that so many Sanders supporters are now talking about supporting Trump. The candidates could not be further from each other in terms of policies or political ideology, the one thing they have in common is that they are, or at least claim they are, not part of the political elite.\n\nI agree that US politics is failing. But I propose that the reason for this has nothing to do with 'the establishment', and certainly not the Democratic party establishment. Instead it is purely the fault of obstructionist Republican congressmen, who shamelessly refuse to push even the most moderate legislation proposed by a president with a clear political mandate. Who are willing to bring the country to the brink of economic calamity by playing games with the debt ceiling. Whose hatred of a president who has been unprecedented in his willingness to create consensus is at best unscrupulous and at worst grounded in racist fear-mongering.\n\nI ask what else the top tier of the democratic party could have done over the past eight years? You may recall that Obama tried to negotiate for single payer healthcare, but without a sufficient majority this was not possible. How is the 'Democratic elite' insufficiently radical when it tired to pass one of Bernie's most prominent policy proposals? If Sanders were president right now rather than Obama why would he be able to pass anything that Obama currently can't? Would he have been able to pass single payer in the 1993 when even a modest healthcare bill was shot down by Republicans? Would he be able to pass campaign finance reforms that are hugely counter to the interests of every incumbent in congress?\n\nIt seems to me that blaming the DNC establishment for the current political crisis is totally misguided. There is one political force that is preventing the passage of the key reforms the US clearly needs and it is not the Democrats. The Democrats are not the ones refusing to acknowledge the Obama's presidency, they are not the ones refusing to listen to reasoned argument, dogmatically sticking to indefensible positions like climate denial in order to appeal to a gullible base, they are not the ones gerrymandering themselves into incumbency.\n\nProgressive voters punishing the top tier of the DNC are like incompetent police officers deliberately shooting a hostage. It is infuriatingly misguided. If people are fed up of US politics then they should punish the people who are actually screwing it up, not attempting to vote in outsiders who have no means of making the situation any better and plenty of means for making it worse.\n\nSo go on then, change my view.\n_____\n\n> *Hello, users of CMV!

            "selftext": "I'm a Sanders supporter who would vote for Stein or the Socialist Party USA in the event of a Hillary nomination. This may or may not make a factor in your arguments, but I live in Texas, which is not a swing state. With that said, there are many times Hillary supporters who try to gaslight Sanders supporters into trying to vote for her because Trump would be much more horrible.\n\nThis is my concession: Hillary would be better at domestic policy than Trump. Although I don't think Trump would be able to get most of what he wants done, simply by the virtue of our legal and legislative system not being accommodating (things like banning Muslims from the United States.) *But*, for the sake of argument, and just looking at their proposals, Hillary would be better than Trump.\n\nMy argument: On the other hand, whereas Hillary would be better than Trump domestically, she'd be a nightmare in the foreign policy arena, much to the point where the domestic benefits of voting for her, against Trump, would be cancelled out, because Trump does not have as hawkish of a foreign policy and would incur a dramatically smaller amount of dead people and chaotic situations overseas.\n\nI'll recognize that if you inherently value an American life more than a non-American, then Hillary is a better choice. I do not feel the same way; I think all life is equal and should be given equal consideration, and this much is not up for debate for me. However, I'd like to see if my view can be changed within the parameters I've laid out.\n\nMy evidence/furtherance of my argument is this:\n\nWhere Donald would be a nightmare domestically, and Hillary would be better, it balances out in the fact that many more people would die under Hillary's administration overseas. For the proof of this, you only have to look at her policy, while she was at State, toward Haiti and Honduras. Haiti is still a hellhole, in part, [because of Hillary's policy toward them](http://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2015/09/hillary-clinton-email-213110), and, as well as that, she helped institutionlize the coup in [Honduras](http://fpif.org/murder-exposed-hillary-clintons-grim-legacy-honduras/), which helped create a humanitarian crisis in the form of child refugees flooding the United States, which she defended [sending back to the country](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/06/18/hillary-clinton-immigration_n_5507630.html) and in which, after that decision, some were [murdered](http://thinkprogress.org/immigration/2014/08/19/3472301/five-children-killed-after-deportation-honduras/). As well as that, people are fairly sure that the military regime she supported are the ones who killed [Berta Caceres](http://www.thenation.com/article/the-clinton-backed-honduran-regime-is-picking-off-indigenous-leaders/). She basically resurrected Reagan's ghost for her time at State.\n\nThat's not even mentioning the fact that she supported the Iraq war, and didn't issue a mea culpa until it was politically necessary in 2007. More over, she was the lead person in the Obama administration toward the policy of overthrowing Gaddafi; and in the case toward Libya, [she resorted to Bush-style tactics in justifying it](https://newrepublic.com/article/121879/hillary-clinton-should-take-blame-disastrous-libyan-intervention). Libya is now a shithole run over by radical Islamists with no hope to recover, and with the body count racking up day-after-day. Her stated policy in Syria is a no-fly zone, which she says would require no ground troops, but the Joint Chiefs of Staff disagree... saying it would [require 70k troops, would require $1bn a month](http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2013-07-22/dempsey-says-syria-no-fly-zone-could-cost-1-billion-a-month), and that was before Russia was getting involved. Now that Russia is involved, it may start a direct war with Russia, in addition to needing more American ground troops in Syria, launching us into yet another Iraq-like war.\n\nAnd, finally, she has saber rattled toward the Iranians, counting them as being proud enemies of hers, and [has not hesitated to say that military force would be used against them under her administration](http://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-politics-iran-idUSN2224332720080422) if they could find a pretext to do it.\n\nThis is all contrasted with Trump's shitty foreign policy, which is more or less limited to Syria, where he says that we will target terrorist's families, so on and so forth. But most of his foreign policy rests upon using sanctions and revoking trade deals. He's one of the few Republicans to say that he wouldn't rip up the nuclear deal with Iran, that he would use sanctions instead of military action, if they step out of line. And that he would use the Chinese trade imbalance to deal with them \"devaluing their currency.\" Which is not a good way to go about these things, but at the very least, the only militarized policy he has, as far as I can tell, is toward Syria, the same as all the other candidates, and would assuredly leave less of a body count across the world as compared to Hillary's whole earth strategy.\n\nSo, if we take the principle seriously, that American lives are just as important as lives overseas, it would appear to me that, in a \"harm reduction\" situation, there is no good option. No harm is reduced by having either of them in office, for different reasons. Trump and Hillary are both extremely harmful in different ways; except one would do more harm here and the other would do more harm overseas. If both things are priorities -- and to me they are -- then it seems like Hillary v. Trump is a wash.\n\nLook forward to the replies!\n\nEDIT 2: I realize this is a contentious argument for some, but I'd appreciate if you (the royal \"you\") actually mounted counter-arguments and... you know... tried changing my view instead of downvoting.\n_____\n\n> *Hello, users of CMV!

            "selftext": "The crux of my argument is this: **The Iraq War was the most racist act by the US government in my lifetime.**\n\nLet me start with a bit about myself.  I'm a second-generation immigrant man of color living in the US Midwest.  I am a progressive atheist, so I'm not interested in arguments from religious, men's rights, or white rights points of view.  I am not planning to vote for either Trump or Clinton. \n\nThe death toll of the Iraq War, beginning with George W. Bush's invasion, ranges from [several](http://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736%2806%2969491-9/abstract) [hundred thousand](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/10/15/iraq-death-toll_n_4102855.html) to [more](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/robert-naiman/how-many-iraqis-did-we-li_b_673683.html) [than](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ORB_survey_of_Iraq_War_casualties) [a million](http://www.justforeignpolicy.org/iraq).  To put it in perspective, that's:\n\n1. more deaths than were caused by both nuclear bombs we dropped on Japan;\n\n1. about as many deaths as the Rwandan genocide;\n\n1. a tenth as many deaths as the Holocaust.\n\n\nProgressives say that racism is the combination of prejudice and power.  That is, racism is measured by results, not by depth of feelings.  Measured by deaths, the Iraq War seems to me more racist than anything the US has done since the Vietnam War.  Its rationale was also bigoted to the core.  When we strip away all the tortured confessions and the propaganda about nukes, what's left is the claim that Saddam Hussein was a brown Muslim just like bin Laden.  Asked about the Iraq invasion during the 2004 debates, Bush claimed [\"the enemy attacked us,\"](http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/politics/debatereferee/debate_0930.html) which only makes sense if Hussein and bin Laden are lumped together.\n\nHillary Clinton voted for the war.  Moreover, as a leader of the opposition party, she gave ideological cover to other Democratic senators who were on the fence about it.  Even now she is unrepentant about her war vote, and she's [palling around with the terrorist Henry Kissinger](http://www.thenation.com/article/henry-kissinger-hillary-clintons-tutor-in-war-and-peace/) whose wars in Asia were even more deadly than hers.  This suggests to me that she is likely to launch [another war](https://www.rt.com/news/332022-assange-clinton-vote-war/) against a developing country if she is elected. Donald Trump, on the other hand, was ambivalent about the war before it started and [turned against it](http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2016/02/20/fact-check-donald-trump-iraq-war/80657524/) several months afterwards.  \n\nTo me, **this difference outweighs all acts of racism by Trump.**  If you disagree, I'd appreciate arguments using numbers and not just words.  How many deaths were caused or would be caused by Trump's racism?  \n\n\n###Counterarguments\nto my argument, ranked from strongest to weakest (in my opinion):\n\n**A** *The devil you know is better than the one you don't.  Sure, Clinton might start a war against a relatively weak country and kill another million people of color, but Trump might start wars against China or Mexico, killing many millions.*\n\nThis is the strongest argument simply because Trump has never held high-level elected office, so we have no idea how he will function in that role.  The Republican Party (and, I'm sure, the Democratic Party) has ways of cracking even the bravest people.  Look at John McCain, maverick war hero, who was made to pick Sarah Palin as his running mate, to accept the 2006 Military Commissions Act letting US torturers off the hook, and to stand by as the Roberts Supreme Court eviscerated his McCain-Feingold campaign finance law.  \n\nThe establishments of both parties want the option of war, and Hillary Clinton is at least as likely to support it.  I don't see Trump trying to enter a bigger war of his own accord.  His distrust of other nations takes the forms of isolationism and protectionism, rather than imperialism; his definition of success seems to be keeping US money here at home, rather than controlling foreign territory.  If you've heard Trump say otherwise, I'd love to read about it.\n\n\n**B** *Trump doesn't believe in global warming, which could kill millions of people, mostly people of color in developing countries.*\n\nBut how many people are actually saved by Clinton's belief in global warming, if she doesn't act on it?  She supported the Iraq War, which put more oil on the global market, and she supported (and may still support) fracking and oil export here at home.  Regarding Clinton, [Naomi Klein says \"I don't trust her on climate at all.\"](http://www.alternet.org/election-2016/naomi-klein-takes-down-hillary-clinton-i-dont-trust-her-climate-all-video)  So, what exactly will she do to reduce global warming, and how many lives will she save?  \n\nPart of my problem, I'll admit, is that given Clinton's past actions, I don't trust her enough to learn about what she claims is her position now.  If you believe that she'll make major progress, though, then convince me!\n\n\n**C** *Trump supports the KKK.*\n\nHow many people were killed?\n\nThe total number of lynchings during the most active years of the KKK is estimated at around [5000](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lynching_in_the_United_States).  Most of those were during the late 19th and early 20th centuries, before Trump was born.  So, even if you took the completely absurd position that Trump's refusal immediately to disavow the David Duke endorsement makes him culpable for all of the Klan's murders through its entire history, the Iraq War would still have killed over a hundred times as many people.\n\nI'm not saying that the KKK is not dangerous.  Based on those numbers, it is the most homicidal terrorist group in US history, out-murdering al Qaeda by thousands.  But it still is a terrorist group, and not a military superpower.  If racism is measured by results and not depth of hatred, then an establishment person with a little bit of hatred (such as Clinton) can carry out far more racist killings than a fringe hatemonger.  I just don't see any way that Trump could help the Klan kill even 10000 people, or about a percent of the Iraq War death toll.\n\n\n**D** *The wall is racist, and Trump is racist against Mexicans.*\n\nClaiming that one race is more rapey than everybody else, and that it's responsible for the US's problems, is certainly racist.  But how many people will it kill?  In 2014, there were about [6000](https://www.fbi.gov/about-us/cjis/ucr/hate-crime/2014/home) hate crimes, including 4 murders, 9 rapes, and about 800 aggravated assaults.  Even if we treat rapes and aggravated assaults as equivalent to murders, and even if we imagine that Trump will increase these numbers tenfold, that will still be about 30000 over four years, far fewer than died in the Iraq War.\n\nAs for the wall, it will kill hardly anyone except through construction accidents, and it'll create jobs that stimulate the economy.  I'd gladly take a hundred walls over one more Iraq War.\n\n\n**E** *People in other countries are not our problem, and Clinton would be much better for us at home.*\n\nLet me make an analogy to a neighborhood in which other countries are families living in neighboring houses.  Then there are two things you could possibly mean with the not-our-problem argument.  One is, \"our neighbors have the same rights to life and liberty as us, but that doesn't mean that we have to help them run their households.\"  Sure, but it does mean that we can't kill them.  If we do something that takes their lives into our hands, such as play with matches and light their house on fire, then we don't get to throw up our hands and say they're not our problem.  We, and society, should consider their lives at least as important as ours.  The deaths of those million Iraqis from our war are on us, and especially on those who voted and advocated for it.\n\nThe other thing that could be meant by the not-our-problem argument is that even when we have started a fire that could kill our neighbors, they still aren't our problem; they simply don't have the same right to life that we do.  That argument is so bigoted that it's making my point for me.  Essentially, pro-war Democrats are offering US progressives a Faustian bargain: let establishment corporations kill millions of people of color around the world for profit, and we'll make your lives more peaceful here at home.  There is no way that I can accept this, especially if the Republicans nominate an anti-war candidate, no matter how much else I dislike about him.\n\n\n**tl;dr:** Hillary and [Henry](http://www.thenation.com/article/henry-kissinger-hillary-clintons-tutor-in-war-and-peace/) sitting in a tree, K-I-S-S-I-N-G(er).  First comes war, then millions die, then come the profits and the Nobel Peace Prize.\n",

            "selftext": "Just to get this out of the way, I support Bernie, for many reasons having nothing to do with this topic, which I only actually looked into today.\n\n(In case you care): there are two powerful reasons that have kept me from caring about this debate before now:  \n1. I've been using \\*n\\*x since childhood and hosted my own email until it became _absurdly_ painful to do so (I'll elucidate as needed). As those knowledgeable on any given subject can attest, journalists and politicians almost always mangle the facts so much that it _hurts_ to see, when you can tell the difference.\n2. I've been turned off to politics for some time now, only barely choking down my cynicism, given the extraordinary circumstances I see around us (example #1: automation), to campaign for Sanders.  So, I had no reason to really care[3], and I followed Bernie's lead, when he said he was sick of hearing about it, until now.\n\nPreemptive arguments:\n\nA: Any 'authorization' may spread the blame, but does not excuse the extraordinary misjudgment.\n\nB: \"I wanted to use one device\"[1]: There are loads of articles about this, but I don't need to read them, to take offense at this statement.  I have a much less sensitive job[2], but this is explicitly against our security policy, and that's not unusual.\n\nC: No evidence of a breach (gist of tons of articles): There often isn't, even when infected by worm or owned by a script kiddie.  In the case of a foreign intelligence agency wanting to set up and listen long term, there's no reason whatsoever to think that they would be detected by even highly competent IT firms, and even if one supposed that whatever firm she used was the very best, (I see mention of two she used _after_ she was out of office, but haven't discovered what firm she used _while_ SecState), it's still an unnecessary increase in attack surface area.\n\nD: I sure as hell don't need Michael Hayden to make my argument for me, but in case you missed it, or want some 'authority':  http://thehill.com/policy/national-security/251451-ex-nsa-director-clinton-email-setup-stupid-and-dangerous\n\n[1] The following youtube video started playing after something else I put on and was listening to in the background.  I heard some interesting quotes, so I paid real attention and began trying to find persuasive counterpoints.  I didn't find any to the points I make above (not that there weren't _invalid_ points in the video); hence this post.  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pW2_onKX5po\n\n[2] You could probably find out where I work, but please don't bring that into this.  Suffice it to say, if you hacked my personal phone or laptop, you (probably!) wouldn't be able to use it to gain access to any of my employer's sensitive information, which, though orders of magnitude less important than the state department's, is still valuable enough that we're regularly spear-phished.\n\n[3] Bernie woke me up to the possibility of our democratic republic still having a pulse, and now I damned well do care, and as much of a fascist-clown Trump is, I tend to think he'll do less damage than an efficient but reckless/selfish member of the establishment in Clinton.  This CMV isn't about changing that view directly, but it would go some of the way, if you earn my delta.\n\nI do have an open mind on the subject, because I distrust any judgment I make ~~after only a couple hours of research, especially when _so_ much has been said~~.  The reason I'm jumping into my first CMV, instead of just continuing my research, is that I strongly suspect that 99% of what has been written on the subject is mangled regurgitation.  I'm not inclined to sift through any more of it; if you have and you think I'm wrong, give me (rinsed) chunks of fact.\n\nedit: escaped some asterisks.\n\n> *Hello, users of CMV!

            "selftext": "The primary elections are, essentially, pandering to the voters of the states. Candidates make promises and statements to convince voters of states to vote for them, and while they don't always completely follow through, sometimes they do. \n\nHowever, the incentive for candidates to campaign and make promises is far greater in winner take all states, as opposed to proportional states. This is because most candidates generally have a base of voters, and end up fighting for the swingy indecisive ones. This means that in proportional states, there is less incentive for the candidate to care about winning. \n\nFor example, in North Carolina, a proportional state, Trump won with 40% of the vote, while Cruz got 36%. Trump got 29 delegates, and Cruz got 27. Sure, Cruz would have preferred to win the state, but if he had spent a lot of effort appeasing voters and ended up getting 40% to Trump's 36%, he would have barely gotten any votes out of it. On the other hand, in Ohio, Kasich got 46.8%, while Trump got 35.6%, but Kasich won all 66 delegates and Trump didn't get any. This meant that Ohio was a key state to the process and got a lot of attention from all candidates, because if they had been able to shift votes just a little they could have gotten a massive swing in vote count.\n\nWe can see that states get more attention and interest by being winner takes all instead of proportional. Therefore, it is in every state's interest to become winner takes all, to encourage campaign spending and pandering in the state. I would also accept loopholey winner takes all such as Illinois, which is technically proportional but since each district is winner takes all Trump got most of the delegates with only 38.8% of the vote\n\n\nEdit: https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/4bcnr2/cmv_all_states_should_be_winner_take_all_in_the/d17xlda Pointed out that proportional encourages candidates who can't all-out win the state to still campaign there a little bit, which changed my view.",

            "selftext": "I'm not a Trump supporter, and I think he has far too many negative qualities. However, on the list of things people call Trump (racist, arrogant, etc.), I always hear that he's sexist, and I don't see it.\n\nI've read a couple of lists of the sexist things that he's said, and most of these lists contain a combination of insults he's used against specific women, comments about how pretty much every women is attracted to him, and advice on marrying women. None of these quotes, though, in context, are actually sexist.\n\nFor example, he's made several negative comments about Rosie O'Donnell, and has called her (along with other women) \"fat\", \"stupid\", and the like. But it's not like he only says these things about women. He's insulted men the exact same way. It's not even like he's using gendered insults, he's just insulting people he doesn't like who happen to be women. That's childish and immature, but not sexist.\n\nHe's also said, for example, that all of the women on \"the Apprentice\" were flirting with him, and that women are attracted to his money and power. But that's not really sexist either, in context. What he's trying to say is that he's living the traditional \"women want him, men want to be him\" life, or at least he thinks he is. Also, at that level of wealth, a much larger percentage of women are attracted to rich and powerful men simply because of their wealth and power. So, to a guy who's been rich pretty much his entire life, that's how women are *all the time*. Gold diggers make up a huge chunk of the women he's been in contact with. So it's understandable. Shortsighted, but not intentionally offensive.\n\nI dunno, maybe I'm just not paying enough attention. It just seems like the vast majority of the \"sexist\" things he's said are just him being stupid and Trumpish and not phrasing things correctly, not him literally thinking women are inferior. He's even gone on record saying he thinks women are not the weaker sex, and that whoever said that originally was an idiot. Change my view, please, so I can return to hating Trump in full.\n_____\n\n> *Hello, users of CMV! This is a footnote from your moderators. We'd just like to remind you of a couple of things.

There is nothing wrong with building a wall to stop illegal immigration on any moral level. Illegal immigrants are a net negative to society, they are criminals and stopping it from happening is a good thing. There is a reason that immigration laws exist, and if people can get over illegally that is not a good thing for the country.\n\nThis is not to say that illegal immigrants are bad people. In fact one of my best friends is the son of an illegal immigrant (now a US citizen) who has a good job, raised good children and from what I can tell is a good person (I have never net him, however, so incant say). However, I don't agree with the thought that it was the right thing to do for him to illegally come to the US. \n\nI also don't think we should have closed borders, and I think that we need to examine  citizenship process. I'm not an expert on the subject so I can't go around making suggestions, but I do think we need to have the most efficient and streamlined way to get people who are upstanding members of society citizenship and visas. I also think that anyone who has not shown to be dangerous or a criminal should be allowed access to our country (unless they have some kind of extremely dangerous disease or some other 1 in a million situation). We need a way to let people like my friends dad (and I'm sure plenty of others who are or were illegally in the US) from getting in that is viable to anyone who wants to.\n\nBut outside of the cost to build I see nothing wrong with building a wall to keep people from being able to illegally enter the country. I don't understand why people oppose this on a moral level but it seems like a lot of people do.\n\nAlso this isn't supposed to be a discussion on Trumps policies. I literally just want to talk about this singular point, because I want to know why the idea of building a wall is supposed to be immoral.\n\nAlso this is obviously coming from an American POV so when I use words like we and us I'm speaking about people in the US, although I don't see how this couldn't apply to other nations as well.",

I do think he is a bigoted xenophobe and electing him would absolutely be a disaster in so many ways. There is every reason to protest him and he should be protested heavily. But there is a time and place for everything.\n\nFree speech is something I think everyone supports it, but everyone's view of it is different. I think Trump has absolutely every right to say what he's saying, regardless of whether or not it's hate speech. Because of this, I think going to his rally and intentionally disrupting it is wrong. The response of Trump and his supporters is also very wrong, but the protesters are at fault. \"But how else can they protest Trump?\". It's easy. The biggest thing I'd think of is to volunteer for the campaign of another candidate, Democrat or Republican, that you support. But there was also a huge organized anti-Trump protest in NYC that didn't coincide with a Trump campaign event. That's the right way to do things.

            "selftext": "Just to clarify, when I refer to \u201cliberalism\u201d I am not referring to the left side of the political binary, I am instead referring to the political philosophy that acts as a foundation for all democratic societies.\u00a0The chief idea behind liberalism is that rational individuals can enter into a social contract with each other in order to preserve their individual interests.\u00a0\u00a0As long as individuals remain rational, they will willingly give up certain freedoms in order to benefit from the collective good.\u00a0\u00a0For example, we all agree that we don\u2019t want to be murdered, so in turn we give up the freedom to murder others.\u00a0\u00a0A more mundane example would be public roads; we all need roads to get from point A to B, so we all give up some of our money via taxes to pay for the roads.\u00a0\n\nMy argument is that while the rational basis of liberalism is a good thing, reaching a subjective understanding of the social contract has also become necessary.\u00a0\u00a0This is primarily because the population\u2019s capacity for rational understanding of increasingly complex policy issues often falls short, making our collective decision-making problematic.\u00a0To bridge this knowledge gap, societies require *trust and empathy* in addition to their capacity for reason.\u00a0\u00a0Trust comes from a subjective sense of intuition; we choose to place our trust in someone when we feel we *know* enough about them to allow our intuition to fill in the rest.\u00a0\u00a0We can never absolutely know a person\u2019s intentions, and we might never be able to grasp that person\u2019s knowledge if that knowledge lies beyond our own capabilities.\u00a0\n\nBut as a liberal society, we have become less and less willing to place trust in those possessing knowledge or capabilities beyond our own.\u00a0\u00a0I think this is at least partially a consequence of the new information age.\u00a0\u00a0Individuals now have unfettered access to information, which they can draw upon to objectively assess the claims of others.\u00a0\u00a0The problem is that access to the raw information does not guarantee a more accurate consensus, but rather replaces trust with contention.\u00a0People have a tendency of making up their mind about an issue first, and then seeking out the studies or objective facts that support their side.\u00a0\u00a0For example, when people argue about gun control they inevitably bring up pieces of statistical evidence that seem to support opposite conclusions.\u00a0\u00a0It is very rare for an individual to approach a subject with an open, rational mind, dispassionately weighing every piece of evidence before reaching a conclusion.\u00a0\u00a0This is especially rare when the subject has some sort of direct impact on the individual.\u00a0\u00a0Gun owners will never believe in studies that purportedly show that gun control would cause a reduction in gun violence, because rather than trust those studies they can just go on the internet and find something that shows that the opposite is true.\u00a0\u00a0In other words, they don\u2019t have to trust the analyses of others because they can just trust themselves in a manner that reinforces their own previously held beliefs.\n\nBut the issue of gun control is not just about objective facts.\u00a0\u00a0To some extent, it also has to do with the subjective principles behind the matter.\u00a0\u00a0The question is not just whether gun control would reduce gun violence, but also whether that effect would be worth the sacrifice of the freedom to own guns.\u00a0There is no objective answer to this question, and there is a lot of gray area in-between, especially since even the objective side of the matter is uncertain and contentious.\u00a0\u00a0This is where *empathy* comes into play.\u00a0\u00a0Societies need empathy, not to reach a certain conclusion about an issue, but to reach a compromise that best fits both sides.\u00a0\u00a0Empathy provides us with an understanding of how the other side exercised both their rationality and subjectivity to reach their conclusion.\u00a0Even if we don\u2019t agree with the conclusion they reached, it is valuable to understand how exactly they came to it so that some sort of middle ground can be reached.\u00a0Those who are unwilling to make concessions or accept a compromise are usually those who are unable to empathize with the other side.\u00a0\n\nI think that Donald Trump is an example of a symptom which arises when societies are falling short on both trust and empathy.\u00a0\u00a0Trump supporters are obsessed with the idea of electing an \u201coutsider\u201d because they know longer have any trust in the knowledge and capabilities of career politicians and policy makers.\u00a0Rather than placing trust in those who accurately present the complex nuances of a political issue, they trust only their own capability to grasp Trump\u2019s absurdly simplified political stances.\u00a0\u00a0Trump supporters have also really fallen in love with Trump\u2019s rhetoric because it lacks any hint of compromise, thus affirming their own personal lack of empathy.\u00a0\u00a0This goes for Democrats, moderate Republicans, and also for any foreign culture.\u00a0Condoning the torture of suspected terrorists and the deportation of immigrants reflects their own inability to empathize with these groups.\n\nSo just to some up my argument one more time, I am basically saying that it is not enough for liberal societies to just be rational.\u00a0\u00a0There needs to be a subjective, perhaps even spiritual basis of trust of empathy to allow societies to bridge gaps in their understanding of both subjective and objective conclusions.\u00a0\u00a0This allows societies to harness the superior understanding of the policy-makers with the most objective knowledge, and reach compromises when differences of subjective principle arise.\n\n\u00a0",

It's simply an echo chamber of 4chan style meme-ing. \n\n* Like many of us, they feel disenfranchised by the MSM, yet overtly exhibit the same tactics to smear opposing views and aggrandize their own. The latest trend of trying to make #TedCruzSexScandal a thing because of an article written by *The fucking National Enquirer?!* Is this real life? I say that as a man who would consider emigrating if Cruz got elected. \n\nThe bottom line is that many of the users in The_Donald exemplify the things that got America to this low point- celebrity idolization, complacency, the idea that 'others will fix the problems, I do not have to change a thing', and overall aggressive behavior towards anyone with a different opinion. They seem unwilling to make any changes in their personal lives at all, and genuinely believe that this man can single-handedly save America. \n\nI do not consider myself a bleeding-heart liberal by any means. In fact I'm probably a little more conservative than a lot of the normal reddit users. Like The_Donald, I'm also fed up with:\n\n-constantly being made to feel guilty for being a white male\n\n\n -political correctness to a fault \n\n\n -SWJs\n\n\n -Tolerance of Islam \n\nHowever, that sub seems to be full of children who have no idea what's actually going on, they just want to yell TRUMP! and post memes about SJWs and 'the liberal agenda', as if every single liberal is calling Trump the next Hitler. \n\n**I do not feel that all conservatives are like this.** In fact, I can't decide if I prefer Trump conservatives or 'establishment' conservatives in the grand scheme of things. But the sheer popularity of The_Donald combined with the content of that sub makes me very concerned about the next decade.\n\nThe_Donald scares the living shit out of me.

            "selftext": "Hello,\n\nThroughout my life I've always felt like I could see some value and good ideas within most political ideologies. As a teenager I initially identified with the Green party, then became more of a socialist in my beliefs, then found libertarianism and decided socialism is great in theory but isn't super pragmatic given certain realities. Then went back to mainstream progressivism and ended up voting for Obama in my first election where I was above 18 (his re-election). Now over the last several years I've been more and more finding my political beliefs still align with most of the modern American liberal ideal, and in some cases I even prefer that we go further - like my support for nationalized single-payer healthcare. But I also identify with a lot of the alt-right: Scott Alexander, Less Wrong, people like that.\n\nThat's all probably useless to you, but I wanted to provide some background to my views.\n\nAnyway, now I'm a mid-20s software developer. I'm not particularly passionate about any of the moral/social issues that drive many others political decisions (LGBT type issues, gun control/rights, abortion, etc) and I don't have a strong idea of whether I agree more with conservative or liberals on most issues. Because in the past I've really been able to empathise with both camps on a wide variety of issues. I find myself caring more about economic policy, government spending allocation, just domestic policy generally. It feels like these things have a greater impact on my day to day life.\n\nThe main things I've identified (in no particular order) that I have a definite preference on are the following:\n\nI have a mix of anti-corporate beliefs, protectionist trade beliefs, pro-socialised healthcare, pro-environment, a belief that government tends to be wasteful, but that in some cases its needed because it can be impartial and serves the people not shareholders, I hate income inequality but as a person earning six figures I only hate those who make seven and believe we should be trying to make more Americans earn six figures and fewer earn five OR seven. I believe in outsiders to politics becoming politicians and have an innate distrust of most career politicians. I don't ever want government to pay for college for everyone as I think we have an education bubble, and don't support loan forgiveness because I sacrificed personally and didn't go to an elite institution as it was too expensive, and instead attended a small, local school to save money. I can't support that those who made the opposite decision get something given to them for free that I sacrificed to be responsible. I guess I'm just a greedy person fundamentally. I've been abroad to multiple countries in Europe, Asia, and Latin America and know how lucky I was to be born in America and have the opportunities I have, but I still strive to someday build enough networth that I can be financially independent and spend my time on creative projects without a need for profit rather than working for 'the man'.\n\nThe reason I believe Trump would be the most likely to improve my quality of life pretty much comes down purely to financial reasons. He's been wishy-washy on it so you might argue it's just populist hand-waving, but he says he will reduce or keep the number of H1Bs granted to high-skilled foreign labor the same. That's contary to many within the political establishment influenced by corporate donors. I believe Sanders may have this belief also, but HRC definitely does not. I want to minimise the risk that my profession becomes worth less because of open immigration of foreign tech workers. It would benefit those who have equity in tech companies, but would decrease the earnings of workers in one of the few high-paid industries left to Americans. And believe me, I've been overseas and know just how lucky we have it. I know that in a globally open labor market you'd see the quality of life of Americans drop incredibly and the rest of the world increase a bit across the board. I also see that Trump would decrease my taxes. Finally, his stated beliefs on trade deals and free trade make me believe he's the least likely to do anything that would hurt domestic industries to the benefit of multinationals and the expense of American workers.\n\nI don't particularly care about anyone's feelings he hurts. I identify with the modern idea of 'Forget political correctness, it's a way to discredit arguments one disagrees with through labeling and associating your ideological opponent with a boogeyman, whether that boogeyman be 'Hitler', 'Stalin', 'a godless commie', or it's 'racist', 'misogynist', or 'islamophobe'. I prefer to let people voice their beliefs whether I agree with them or find them outright offensive. And I give most people the benefit of the doubt and assume they meant no ill will when they said something 'offensive'.\n\nThe one argument that I can see potentially making me afraid to vote for him would be that he's too loose of a cannon diplomatically/militarily, but I believe his campaigning is an act he's putting on to appeal to certain voters. I've seem him in interviews in the past (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rksd80-FCAw and https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZpMJeynBeg) where he's much more reasoned and nuanced in the way he speaks. I can't help but believe he's just using populism (albeit, populism that appeals to consevative talk radio listeners, not populism that's socialist / down with the 1% style), and I follow Scott Adams' analysis of Trump's campaign as a lesson in persuasion (http://blog.dilbert.com/post/141428843311/social-media-is-the-new-government and http://blog.dilbert.com/post/141090636816/donald-trump-con-man).\n\nEssentially I think he wouldn't really be the loose cannon he's acting like now, but that he'd just be a more unfiltered speaker than the average politician. I think his current bluster is an act. And beyond that act, I think his policies seem most likely to give me the most economic security within my profession (due to his opposition to H1Bs and also trade deals that benefit multinationals at the expense of domestic workers) and at the end of the day decrease my taxes. One of my long-term goals is to be financially independent so I can pursue creative work independently, and so anything that improves my paycheck is very important to me.\n\nChange my view I guess. I would consider Sanders maybe if he won the nomination because I love the idea of moving towards single-payer healthcare, but I hate his 'free college' model. We've seen how well that works in many European economies where everyone has 15 master degrees but youth unemployment is off the charts. I think the appeal of Trump that I stated in the previous paragraph would still push me into the Trump camp anyway.\n\nHRC doesn't hold much appeal to me at all. Seems too corporately owned and for whatever reason when she gives speeches it comes across as really robotic to me. It sounds like what an eleven year old pretending to give a speech as a president would sound like to me. But maybe that doesn't matter because it's just putting aesthetics over policy and being incredibly shallow. I don't know.\n\nI could see the appeal of voting third party to signal to the main two parties that they should shift their platform, but I think that would give me a lower return on my vote than just voting for Trump.\n\n_____\n\n> *Hello, users of CMV!

More and more I keep seeing articles like this and ZERO solutions. The clear reason for it is because apparently there IS no solution. Society as a whole will not accept not eating meat, taking bikes (since for a lot of people it's not even an option, buying more responsibly (ditto), etc. The message is evident: WE ARE DOOMED.\n\nThere is absolutely nothing that I can do (though I don't have a car and have vowed to never have children, which are probably the biggest two things you can do for the planet) and I cannot live in the best case scenario society:\nAll my entertainment is derived from technology, most people don't like my deep topics of conversation and I cannot reach their level (I don't care about sports, I don't care about the weather, I don't care about irrelevant events in the lives of others). I don't even like group activities. I will not be able to stand having to spend most of the day farming and hanging out with people I find utterly uninteresting.\nSince I am such a loner I am utterly incapable of surviving a disaster scenario. Therefore, my best course of action is to live a solitary existence. I don't plan for the future since there is no future. Why get into debt to buy a house, since it will be worth nothing? Why plan for a long term career, since it will all collapse? Why raise a family, since it will be people I will have to defend and likely see slaughtered and raped in front of me, all cursing my name for not being able to defend them?\nIf there is no hope, why should I expect a tomorrow? I don't want to go out fighting, I see no point on it. I might as well just stay in my room and play videogames until the apocalypse and finally hang myself when the time comes. Why not follow this plan? Why not enjoy the money I have right now in buying fancy clothes for myself? Even if a God were to somehow exist, in the words of an anonymous Auschwitz prisoner, he would have to BEG for my forgiveness and if He were to send me to eternal torment I would raise both middle fingers all the way to the firey inferno.\n\nThe only alternative I see is if suicide were subsidized, which I would take in a heartbeat. Let someone take my organs if the alternative is being stuck in hell. Hell, just the idea of Trump winning is enough to make me want to kill myself.\n_____\n\n> *Hello, users of CMV!

            "selftext": "In the American Justice system, arrest records are public, and it's easy for newspapers to find out what someone has been charged with. From high-profile celebrities to average people, all of this information is easily accessed. However, I think people should be kept anonymous until found guilty. This reform would consist of the following: \n\n1. When someone is arrested, it is kept public that they were arrested, however the charges are kept private to prevent from their reputation being tarnished. This prevents abuse by law enforcement, so they cannot \"disappear\" someone, as they would be able to do if the arrest records themselves were kept private. This both keeps the media from publishing information that could tarnish the reputation of an innocent individual, as well as making jury selection easier, as fewer people will be biased by news coverage of the defendant's charges. \n\n2. The defendant and their attorneys are provided access to any and all charges against them. A neutral 3rd party is also entrusted with the charges, and empowered to to postpone a trial in the event of charges being added the day of. This is to prevent prosecutors from withholding charges from the defendant and their attorneys until the court date in order to prevent them from putting together an adequate defense. \n\n3. During the trial, the defendant is kept anonymous, using vocal filters and methods to obscure their appearance. This is to prevent the jury from being biased based on any personal aspects of the defendant, and to ensure that judgments are made solely based on the facts. In essence, ensuring that Justice is blind. This will also be done for expert witnesses, with the exception that their credentials are provided to the jury, in order to judge the merits of their claims. \n\n4. In the event the defendant is found innocent, their arrest record is purged. An anonymous version of court records is maintained for the purpose of maintaining precedent and keeping records, however the defendant's identity is purged from the records. If they are found guilty, then their arrest and conviction record becomes public record, unless they are exonerated later. \n\n5. The defendant should be able to waive the right to privacy at any point. This is their right, however they'll have to deal with the consequences of doing so. Unauthorized breaches of privacy should be punished, to deter people from violating the defendant's privacy. \n_____\n\nThere's a couple things I have to support a system such as this. The big thing is that there are many things a defendant can do in order to reduce their chances of being convicted. A good example is [wearing glasses](http://www.thejuryexpert.com/2011/03/eyeglasses-and-mock-juror-decisions/). Implicit bias is a major determining factor of a juror's decision on someone's guilt, and if something as small as glasses can alter the outcome of trials, then other things(race, gender, etc) most definitely play a part. These unconscious biases prevent juries from ruling solely on the merit of the facts, as they should be. \n\nSecondly, having an arrest record, even without a conviction, can cause hardship to innocent people. [Here's](http://articles.latimes.com/2005/aug/21/news/adna-rapsheet21) [some](http://talkpoverty.org/2014/12/09/held-back-by-a-criminal-record/) [stories](https://www.abine.com/blog/2011/online-guilty-before-proven-innocent/) about that. While some states have laws preventing this, not all do. Regardless, one of the cornerstones of the justice system is \"Innocent until proven guilty\". People should not be judged or prevented from finding employment because of arrests that did not lead to a conviction. This system prevents people's charges being broadcast through the media and staying in perpetuity regardless of the actual outcome. \n\nOur justice system is supposedly blind, but people are judged on a million things regardless of the facts. Even after they're innocent, those records can haunt them for the rest of their lives. Some people might think this is infringing on the press's right, but the individual's privacy should trump the press's rights until such a time as they're found guilty. The government in this case would have a compelling interest to abridge the Press's 1st Amendment rights, as they're protecting potentially innocent citizens. This system protects those who are innocent while allowing the press to report on those who are guilty. It's a happy medium between privacy, free speech, and protection from abuse. In today's information age, Anonymous Until Proven Guilty is the same as Innocent Until Proven Guilty.\n_____\n\n> *Hello, users of CMV! This is a footnote from your moderators.

            "selftext": "In recent elections, a number of prominent presidential candidates have arisen from the private sector, rather than the traditional political avenues. Herman Cain, Carly Fiorina, and Donald Trump all fit this mold of having no political experience, and have campaigned touting their business expertise as their primary qualification for running the country. \n\nWhile I believe that some elements of business leadership cross over as vital skills for political leadership, running a government organization is a fundamentally different exercise than running a business. There are many other differences to consider, but here are a few off the top of my head:\n\n-The success of a business is measured almost exclusively in terms of dollar-value profit to shareholders. The success of a country can be measured a thousand different ways, many of which run counter to the notion of maintaining an optimal financial position. \n\n-Leading a government requires a deep understanding of the law and how it works, while success in business simply requires avoiding/minimizing instances where the law is broken. \n\n-Government relies on having some measure of consensus built for the purposes of passing and enforcing legislation. In business, leaders are often empowered to set some policies as they see fit, provided that profits are not drastically reduced. \n\n-A business that falls on hard times can enact mass layoffs, declare bankruptcy, or go out of business entirely, and society at large will move on. The stakes of failure as a government are much higher. \n\nThere are others, but you get the idea. I want to clarify that I don't think business experience is useless in the government arena: corporate leaders have a lot of valuable lessons that could apply to government in certain contexts, and I think that someone who ran a successful company and later enjoyed political success as a governor or senator could rightfully tout their qualifications in a presidential run. I just think that business success is not enough on its own to qualify someone for the presidency. \n\n\n> *Hello, users of CMV! This is a footnote from your moderators.

But on the big issues that could have serious impact on the lives of people living in the US - immigration, taxes, foreign policy, gun rights, free speech, health care, higher education, and the overall size and scope of the federal government - they are close to polar opposites. \n\nThere's no way that a person who supports Bernie, but who will vote for Trump, is thinking *\"you know I'd like to have free health care and a path to citizenship for undocumented immigrants, but I'll settle for continuing with the current health care system and deporting all illegals.\"* But last week, The Guardian asked 700 Bernie Sanders supporters who they would vote for if Hillary wins the nomination and 500 of them said they'd seriously consider Trump while only 200 said they'd vote Hillary. (Source: http://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/mar/13/bernie-sanders-supporters-consider-donald-trump-no-hillary-clinton )\n\nThis makes **absolutely** no sense if you consider any of the candidates stances on virtually any issue. So I believe a large percentage of Bernie Sanders supporters don't actually support him for his policies but rather because of what he represents (or rather what he *doesn't* represent). They can't stand the status quo and want to see drastic change more than they want free college or free health care or to see a path to citizenship for undocumented immigrants.\n\nChange my view.\n\n_____\n\n> *Hello, users of CMV!

            "selftext": "On Trump and Sanders it's important to recognize that their policies on trade are not that different from each other.  Trump has said that there\u2019s little daylight between them on the issue of trade, while Sanders has praised Trump\u2019s \"favorable statements\" on single-payer healthcare.  Both claim to believe \"open borders\" immigration is a plot by Wall Street to undercut American workers:  \u201cWhat [the Koch Brothers] would love is an open-border policy,\u201d Sanders said recently. \u201cBring in all kinds of people, work for $2 or $3 an hour, that would be great for them. I don\u2019t believe in that.\u201d  Sanders calls open borders \"a trendy libertarian idea\u201d that \"would benefit the wealthy few at the expense of the many.\"     Trump\u2019s immigration paper states that \u201creal immigration reform puts the needs of working people first \u2014 not wealthy globe-trotting donors.\u201d  As Trump supporter and polemicist Ann Coulter puts it: \"Donors want cheap labor!\"  In an interview on The View, Coulter claimed \"the rich\" support \"open borders\" for the \"cheap labour and the cheap maids.\"  Forbes magazine slammed Ann Coulter for her article in Townhall where she decried \u201cthe harm cheap labor being dumped on the country does to the millions of unemployed Americans.\u201d  According to an article in Time magazine entitled \"Why Conservatives Praise Bernie Sanders on Immigration,\" Sanders opposed comprehensive immigration reform in 2007 on the grounds that it would expand the number of guest workers in the United States. It included a measure that would allow 200,000 guest workers to stay in the country for two years on temporary visas. The bill was widely supported by immigrant rights groups and would have put the undocumented on a path to citizenship.\n\n\u201cIf poverty is increasing and if wages are going down, I don\u2019t know why we need millions of people to be coming into this country as guest workers who will work for lower wages than American workers and drive wages down even lower than they are now,\u201d Sanders said in a television interview in June 2007.    \n\nTime goes on to say that joining Sanders in opposing the 2007 immigration bill was the AFL-CIO, the largest coalition of labor unions in the country\u2014as well as staunchly right-wing conservative members of Congress like Steve King and advocates like Glenn Beck.\n\n\u201cThe reality is employers hire desperate aliens who will work for much less than Americans, driving wages down and making it impossible for American workers to compete,\u201d King said in May 2007, as quoted in Time.\n\n\u201cIt does not make a lot of sense to me to bring hundreds of thousands of [foreign] workers into this country to work for minimum wage and compete with Americans kids,\u201d Time quotes Sanders saying in 2013.\n\nSanders and Trump oppose NAFTA, TPP, and all trade agreements.   Trump called NAFTA \"a disaster\" and said that he would renegotiate or break the North American Free Trade Agreement.  Sanders voted against NAFTA and called NAFTA a \"disaster for the American worker\" and he has laid out his argument in opposition to the North American Free Trade Agreement.  In 1993 Sanders predicted that \"this fast track agreement with Mexico will be a disaster for our working people, for our farmers, and for the environment in general.\u201d \n \n Sanders argues we must \u201cdevelop trade policies which demand that American corporations create jobs here, and not abroad,\u201d and said that \"Trade is a good thing, but what we must begin doing is negotiating fair trade agreements.\u201d  According to Trump's campaign platform entitled REFORMING THE U.S.-CHINA TRADE RELATIONSHIP: \"in order for [free trade] to bring prosperity to America, it must also be fair trade.\" Trump has stated \"I Like Trade But It Has To Be Equal or Better for Us. You look at what China is doing to us in trade, you look at what Mexico is doing to us at the border and in trade.  They're killing us at the border, they're taking our jobs, they're taking our money, and we get nothing.\"   \n\nSanders' campaign website claims \"Since 2001, nearly 60,000 manufacturing plants in this country have been shut down and we have lost over 4.7 million decent paying manufacturing jobs. NAFTA has led to the loss of nearly 700,000 jobs. PNTR with China has led to the loss of 2.7 million jobs. Our trade agreement with South Korea has led to the loss of about 75,000 jobs.\"  Trump on August 25 2015, was quoted by CNN saying of China, \"They want our people to starve - they're taking our business away. They've taken our jobs away.\" \nTrump then went on to berate companies that move jobs to Mexico:  \"Our companies are moving into Mexico more than almost any other place right now. We are losing our industry. We're losing our business to Mexico.\"  \n\nTrump has called for a boycott of all Nabisco products because Nabisco moved their Oreo factory from Chicago to Mexico.  In 2011 Sanders declared war on Chinese bobble heads sold in the Smithsonian gift shop: \u201cIn the gift shops we should not be selling statues of the founding fathers of this country that were made in China.\u201d     Sanders campaign states: \"Bernie firmly believes that current trade relations with China are detrimental to job growth and wealth equality in the United States.\"\n\n  Sanders called the TPP trade agreement \"disastrous\" and Trump called TPP \"a horrible deal.\"  Trump claims TPP was \"designed for China to come in, as they always do, through the back door and totally take advantage of everyone.\"  On TPP Sanders said \u201cWall Street and other big corporations have won again.\"\n\nOn China devaluing it's currency, Sanders gave an interview to MSNBC where he called on China to be \"punished\" for currency manipulation.  Donald Trump has claimed that China's yuan devaluation was designed to \"suck the blood out of the United States,\" and says he would tax Chinese goods to stop China's currency devaluation, slapping tarriffs on Chinese products entering the US if China does not stop devaluing the yuan.\n\nSean Higgins at the Washington Examiner claims labour unions are giving \"serious thought\" to endorsing Donald Trump.  Higgins says the 1.4 million-member International Brotherhood of Teamsters announced its executive council would put off a decision on a presidential endorsement due a lack of consensus caused partly by members' support for Trump, and that the union was seeking a meeting with Trump.  Higgins cites Teamsters spokesman Galen Munroe referring to a statement by union President James P. Hoffa, which did not mention Trump but did say, \"The Teamsters will work with and support any candidate who puts the needs of America's working families above the deep pockets of their corporate donors.\"  Higgins claims the following day, Chris Shelton, president of the 600,000-member Communication Workers of America, told Politico that his union was putting off a presidential endorsement for the same reason. \"If our members come out with Donald Trump, then we're going to endorse Donald Trump,\" Shelton said.  According to International Business Times, Mary Kay Henry, president of the Service Employees International Union SEIU, said she has directed her 2.1 million members to help defeat Trump.  Henry told the Times her organization is going into \u201chyperdrive\u201d because Trump appeals to \"some\" of her members.\n\nTrump's plan calls for \"deploying [the U.S. military] appropriately in the East and South China Seas\" to \"discourage Chinese adventurism that imperils American interests in Asia and shows our strength as we begin renegotiating our trading relationship with China.\"  Sanders campaign platform states \"Bernie believes we must deter China\u2019s military build-up\" by \"The denial of participation in cooperative research and development\" and by stopping the export to China of US intellectual property that could have \"dual use\" (military) potential.  Trump's platform warns \"The Chinese government forces American companies like Boeing, GE, and Intel to transfer proprietary technologies to Chinese competitors\" and promises to \"Protect American ingenuity and investment by forcing China to uphold intellectual property laws and stop their unfair and unlawful practice of forcing U.S. companies to share proprietary technology.\"  Trump's campaign then goes on to decry China for their \"lax labor and environmental standards.\"  Sanders wrote in the Guardian an essay titled \"So-called 'free trade' policies hurt US workers every time we pass them\":  \"[Free trade] is part of an effort to boost the profits of large corporations and Wall Street by offshoring jobs, undercutting worker rights, and dismantling labor, environmental, health, food safety and financial laws.\"  At the South Carolina Freedom Summit, Donald Trump claimed that he would impose a hefty 35 percent tariff on American multinational corporations in order to stop outsourcing to China and elsewhere.  \"China is ripping us off and abusing us,\" said Trump. \n\n.",

            "selftext": "Despite what the mainstream media, like FOX, CNN, and MSNBC, have covered, all contributed to Trump's success in being a presidential candidate.\n\nMedia bias. And Trump is winning off of it. As far as I understand, there are two things that keep Trump from being a \"Democrat\". The Wall, and his intentions of deporting illegal immigrants. Everything else he has campaigned on is purely liberal leaning politics. His view on abortion as recent coverage has put it is that he is against abortion, however, that isn't the case. If you actually watched the interview, the question was rather **if it was illegal** should there be consequences? Trump said yes there should be consequences.\n\nIf you think about it, that's a pretty sensible answer: if it's illegal should there be punishment? What would it be illegal for if there was no punishment? Hey guys, it's illegal to steal, but you can't get sentenced to jail or pay any fine if convicted for it.\n\nTrump is also a long supporter of the gay community, and does not care about forgin entanglements like Israel. Trump has also gone on the record saying that he wants to give tax breaks to the lower income and middle income wage earners and to not give tax breaks to higher income wage earners, or progressively tackle income gaps.\n\nLet's get back to the point: the media has a lot to do with his success. The more they squander attention on him the more people look at him and see a rather sensible liberal with a pretty central political standpoint. The more people who see this the more support he gets. He has a pretty straightforward campaign. It's actually pretty crazy to think the republican voters want him because he isn't religious, he isn't conservative... But he is staunch for America. They have no reason to believe the media coverage of this guy who's only flaw is that he has a multimillion dollar company.\n\nAnd here is the kicker, if they payed no attention to him the first place he wouldn't have ever gotten so far. But he played them just like he said he would almost 30 years ago. He layed out his plan on TV. He told everyone exactly how he would do it and they fell for it anyways.\n\nFor me, I disagree with him on many of things. I'm actually a libertarian who thinks this guy is crazy. But he's crazy good at what he does. That's why he's got my support. He won't \"make America great again\" because it has always been great, but he has already done a lot for America just for running. To the people that actually listen to what his campaign is: He exposed to the silent majority that there is an extreme flaw in media coverage. He exposed the way media treats candidates just purely based on the notion of party affiliation.\n\nThe republican establishment doesn't want him because he's liberal. The democrat establishment doesn't want him because he wants a wall and to deport illegal immigrants. He could literally be the way to destroy the establishment and it starts at the media. And no one knows what to do with him or how to report about him simply because he is running as a republican. It's purely the media's fault for this.\n\nTake note that I added some of his campaigning to emphasize why the media and the establishment democrats/republicans are to blame for his success. You can literally look up what he campaigns on by going to his website... So you can either listen to what CNN or FOX tells you he campaigns on and either call him crazy or rationalize him, or what he tells you he campaigns on and call him crazy or rationalize him. Either way, the attention has been gathered by the media.\n\nPlease change my view.\n\n\nJust so you know, I will be at work in a few hours. I will reply when I can to any comments.\n\nEdit 1: because I'm getting the \"his supporters are under-educated, Trump speaks at 4th grade level English, he is a woman hater comments.\n\nThis view IS NOT BASED ON HIS CAMPAIGN. It is purely based on media coverage. The media KEEPS covering him and that is how he is still doing so good. This shows a flaw in the MEDIA, not Trump. Media's take: cover Trump. Media's intentions: destroy Trump. Media's result: More Trump support.\n_____\n\n> *Hello, users of CMV! This is a footnote from your moderators. We'd just like to remind you of a couple of things.

            "selftext": "First off, let me say that I am staunchly pro-choice.  I support a woman's right to choose what to do with her body, and as a man, it's not really any of my business anyways.\n\n\nThat's one of the reasons why I've always voted Democrat in the past.  In fact, in my primary, I went and phonebanked and caucused for Bernie Sanders.  I believed (and still do, to a certain extent) in his proposals to break up the big banks, close tax loopholes, and get big money out of politics.\n\n\nRecently though, I've been gravitating more towards the other side of the spectrum, to Donald Trump.  And I've found that a lot of what the two candidates are saying is pretty similar--both want the government to lead the way in healthcare, both want to get rid of SuperPACs, and both want to fix the broken political system in our country.\n\n\nObviously, there's many differences between them, too.  And one of those big differences is abortion.  It's one of the big issues I've always had with the Republican party; the reason I was able to set it aside with Trump is because it's blindingly obvious that it's not something he particularly cares about.  It's not a huge part of his platform, and it's not something I've heard him talk about all that much unless he's asked about it.\n\n\nSo, on to the real issue: what he said yesterday.  I feel that it's been completely overblown and taken out of context.  What he said, essentially, was this: IF abortion were to be made illegal, and IF you look at abortion as taking a human life, then there should be \"some sort of punishment\" for doing that.\n\n\nI mean, isn't that obvious?  If people view abortion as ending a human life, then shouldn't they support punishing those who get abortions?  Furthermore, he's talking about IF, hypothetically, abortion were to be made illegal.  If something is illegal, there's usually a punishment for doing it.\n\n\nTo me, this is the biggest non-issue of the entire campaign.  If someone supports making abortion illegal, then of course they would want to punish people who get abortions.  That should be blindingly obvious.  Everyone's up in arms like he just said he wanted to commit genocide--I guarantee you what most pro-life candidates, if they were to get their way and make abortion illegal (which wouldn't happen anyways), would be forced to put in some sort of legal punishment for women who get illegal abortions.  Why is it so bad when he's up-front about it?\n\n\nAnd before everyone gets out their pitchforks, I should probably say again that I am firmly pro-choice.  I just don't see this as that big of an issue overall.\n_____\n\n> *Hello, users of CMV! This is a footnote from your moderators. We'd just like to remind you of a couple of things.

            "selftext": "Recently we implemented a policy of tagging election-related threads so that users could avoid them. We see now that this is a mistake. Allowing users access to an election-free version of CMV allows people to avoid confronting their biases and prejudices about this election and keeps them from making the most informed possible choice in this very important matter. \n\nAfter much discussion and soul-searching, we've realized that the only morally correct thing to do is to put CMV into *election-only mode* until after November. In *election-only mode*, all CMV posts must be about views relating to either Bernie Sanders or Donald Trump. By stepping up and doing what other subreddits have failed to do - giving users a place on reddit that they can discuss the election - we hope to provide a vital service to our democracy. \n\nIn order to facilitate this change while keeping the tone of discourse that our sub is known for, we will be adding at least 200 new moderators. Please apply in this thread with a link to the cutest puppy picture you can find and a series of haikus about your moderation experience and skills. \n\nTo avoid conflicting with today's theme of CMVLikeIAMA, *election mode* will go into effect starting tomorrow. Let's make this subreddit great again!\n\n**FAQ**\n\n*What about posts about Hillary Clinton?*\n\nI'm sorry. We simply cannot add enough new moderators to properly moderate CMV threads on Hillary Clinton at this time. \n\n*What about Ted Cruz?*\n\nWho?\n\n*What if I'm a non-U.S. redditor?*\n\nWho?",

It's really something, let me tell you. I went from being routinely mocked last year as a fringe candidate to the front-runner of of the Republican party. And I've always been a Republican, I love my Bible - I love it, believe me, I'm all about the Bible. I'm all about our Judeo-Christian background and that's what we need to keep America strong in the world. Republican values like family values and family morals, also we've got to be tough on China and Mexico.\n\nI'm the only guy saying this stuff! Just ask anyone at my rallies, they'll tell ya they hear straight talk from me that none of the other candidates can deliver. Nobody else talks about the issues. Rubio was too focused on trying to measure the size of my \"hands\" (geez, that guy is obsessed by body parts, creepy!). And Ted's a liar, like of the highest caliber. Jon Kasich is so low energy that he makes Jeb look like he's on cocaine.\n\nAnd Hillary! She's such a corporate stooge. See I ran business, I never kowtowed to them like she did. I know how to manage a large organization, and that's why the American people are increasingly turning to me as a strong leader. We need STRONG, DECISIVE leadership. Not weak leadership, strong leadership! Not indecisive leadership, decisive leadership!\n\nBut our current president and his party are letting America down, let me tell you. I talked to - I talked to like eight people just yesterday whose jobs were taken by illegal immigrants and what does the president do about it? Nothing, he's done nothing. Mexico just keeps sending their rapists and criminals over and Obama will just bend over for them (you know, bend over to pick up their trash). He won't secure our borders. I will.\n\nI know a lot of people are moaning and gnashing their teeth about my candidacy but I see no reason to quit. After all, this is how democracy works, right? The people choose. And right now it sounds like the people are choosing me.\n\n_____\n\n> *Hello, users of CMV! This is a footnote from your moderators. We'd just like to remind you of a couple of things.

However, Trump was answering a question about a hypothetical situation in which abortion is illegal.  So why would the woman who seeks out an abortion in this scenario not be charged with a crime and punished?  If you look at the act like conspiracy to commit murder, I think a punishment is justified for both the woman and the doctor in this hypothetical situation.  I don't understand why the woman would be treated as a victim unless the procedure was done without her consent.  We punish drug dealers and drug users, the drug user is not the victim of the drug dealer in our current legal system.  So why would this scenario be any different?  I feel like Trump simply took the pro-life thesis that abortion is murder to its logical conclusion, and I am surprised that pro-life and pro-choice alike came out against him.\n\n_____\n\n> *Hello, users of CMV!

            "selftext": "EDIT: my title was a little bit too bold. I mostly want to focus on the current political environment of liberals vs conservatives with respect to the presidential race. I'm basically arguing that Bernie supporters are more violent and polarizing than Trump supporters.\n\nEdit 2: oh how I love getting down voted for sharing an unpopular opinion on a subreddit which is about sharing unpopular opinions. Even my comments about how I've changed my mind are getting downvoted for some reason \n\nI know that there is a lot of support for Bernie Sanders and the far left on reddit so hopefully you can help me change my view.\n\nIn the past few months, the far left in America has become increasingly violent towards anyone who doesn't share their views, using the idea that they are on the moral high ground as an attempt of justifying their violence. There have been countless examples of violence breaking out at Trump rallies because of anti-Trump protesters. The first major example of violence being at the [Trump rally in Chicago](http://www.cnn.com/2016/03/11/politics/donald-trump-chicago-protests/) where Trump-protesters caused the rally to be postponed, and violence quickly erupted. \n\nA lot of people blame Trump supporters, or even Donald Trump himself, for inciting the violence, but I believe that the protesters themselves are entirely to blame. Looking at the above article, you can see that not only are the protesters unforgiving for the violence they caused but actually proud of the fact, believing that they made some kind of real difference in the world by terrifying a bunch of innocent people, plus [police officers](https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-K_odCknfWTM/VuO7gA1yZXI/AAAAAAAAE1A/L70tPZ5jKhYmEX_ltbWQ-vGW4uRoHXo0A/s1600/Protest%2B2.jpg) Here's two quotes from the event, the first from a protester, the second from a Trump supporter:\n\n\"I've never been more proud of my city,\" Hernandez told CNN.\n\nPatrick said, \"This is scaring the hell out of me, trying to leave here.\" AND, Asked if she would still vote for Trump on Tuesday, she said, \"Absolutely, more than ever.\"\n\nThere have been many other examples of leftist extremists being obstructive and causing violence. [Here is a video of Trump protesters blocking an ambulance](https://twitter.com/tweetbrettmac/status/708525579600064512)\n\n[While I understand that there are facebook trolls, this is pretty telling as well](http://i.imgur.com/RWNfYRh.png) I have a lot of Bernie supporters on my facebook and they are all very aggressive against Trump (and even Hillary) but are so disillusioned by the idea that they are morally right that they don't even realize how violent they are being. \n\nMost recently was [this](http://downstreampolitics.com/2016/03/30/trump-protester-punched-elderly-man-actually-19-years-old/) event where a Trump-protester was maced by a Trump fan, causing Bernie supporters to get all up in arms. In reality, this protester punched an old man in the face, and was maced by a bystander to defend the man.\n\nI could go on and on with violent acts caused by leftist protesters under the guise of stopping people who they don't agree with. But now I want to hear the other side of the story, or at least some justifications for these people's actions. Because honestly it is getting ridiculous and is polarizing our nation more than anything else. I'm looking forward to a good discussion. ",

Systematically overthrowing Latin American governments and replacing them with puppets has being the bread and butter the US\u2019 foreign policy. The war on drugs has endured despise open opposition of some of the Latin American government forced to enforce it, putting thousands of dead bodies on the streets.

It would be impossible for the US to maintain control over Latin America when its public face openly hates the place.\n\nThe election of Trump would lead to Latin America to diplomatically turn its back to the US, reinforcing with it the local institutions such as the Unasur and the Celac.

            "selftext": "Something I have always maintained (Which may be a CMV for another time), is the current \"Punch and Judy\" politics the UK has is mostly a good thing, ensuring better leadership, mostly because the fast thinking wit and debate required to hang with such a system\n\n1: Precludes good leadership qualities. A UK leader needs to be able to debate with others, and do so quickly (As much as JC supporters may suggest that every statement being throughoutly vetted and researched is a good thing, in reality if you're waiting a week to reply to world leaders, Putin has already annexed Wales before you can even respond :D)\n\n2: It stops the more... retarded elements of politics. Could you imagine Trump, or Bush managing to respond in a eloquent way? Trump would probably try and build a wall in parliment an get the Queen to pay for it. For all the hate they get, and whether you agree with their politics or not, there's not been a UK PM in recent times which came across as... thick. \n\nAnd I feel this second reason is the main cropper as to why Jeremy doesn't want to \"lower himself\", because he knows he'll lose.\n\nLooking at his oppositional strategy sings a song of someone who has literally no reactive capabilities. A good example recently is the resignation of a major governmental figure: IDS. Ian Duncan Smith resigned from the cabinet, and basically in smarter nicer words, called the Tories a bastard. Yet we saw JC go on about completely unrelated things, once again sticking to a script presumably written weeks beforehand. New politics or not, it's literally the job of the opposition to hold the government to account, for instance when a major government figure resigns over the government doing cunty things. This is a task the Tories themselves are doing a better job at. Doing otherwise and continuing on his unfocused strategy sparks of incompetence.\n\nThis is a person who got 3 D's at A levels, and then dropped out of uni (Should be noted he comes from a rich family, so lotsa privilege and shit), who gives the impression that he couldn't give a witty retort even if his life depended on it, not due to some wanting to be \"Nice\", but due to a lack of capability to do so.\n_____\n\n> *Hello, users of CMV!

            "selftext": "I always found it odd that for all the whining and moaning I hear about SJWs and radical third wave feminists, I never actually encounter people that embody these beliefs in the flesh nor do I see their presence much online (except when they're at the butt of a reddit attack). As I've observed the viewpoints of the \"new right\" (herein referred to as Alt-right) being espoused more and more on places like reddit, large Facebook groups, in games (annoyingly), YouTube comments (Yes I sometimes read them), and more generally on any online forum or social network that young, western males frequent, I've also found it odd that I haven't seen the same concentrated, negative reaction to the new right that I've seen to SJWs on websites like reddit. From my perspective, the reddit community seems to be in a state of perpetual rage over SJWs and goes to great length to cherry pick instances of SJWs going nuts (online or off), however the Alt-right doesn't have such a label nor are its members grouped together and taken on in the same way that SJWs are. \n\nPeople complain about /r/The_Donald and its users (those who say \"cuck\" (\"cuckservative\") so often they sound like chickens), but it isn't generally recognized that most young Donald Trump supporters represent the Alt-right way of thinking. The Alt-right in general isn't generally recognized or targeted at all by people who don't subscribe to their ideology. Currently, the Alt-right is using the (often justifiable) hatred of the \"regressive left\" as a vehicle to recruit more members, typically young white males.  \n\nAfter thinking about it and witnessing it for a long time, it hit me that the reason I seem to run into people espousing Alt-right ideology every single time I use the internet is because I'm part of the same demographic, frequent the same places and have many overlapping interests with many of them (I'm a gamer addicted to reddit, I'm a white western male, I don't use Twitter or Tumblr etc). The main difference is that I'm a bit older (early 30s), which is probably why I don't *know* anyone in either camp personally and why it's taken me so long to get my head around it. I'm also Canadian and don't think my country is polarized to the same extent as the US or parts of Europe (due to the refugees), though I'm sure new right ideology is gaining ground in Canada as well. \n\nAnyway, before this gets to wordy, here's the Wikipedia definition of the Alt-right:\n\n*The alt-right includes beliefs such as neoreaction, monarchism, nativism, populism, national capitalism, identitarianism, white nationalism, antisemitism, racialism, white supremacism and American secessionism.[1][2] Commonalities shared across the otherwise loosely defined alt-right include disdain for mainstream politics, strong support for the Donald Trump presidential campaign, 2016, and anti-Jewish and anti-Zionist views.[5][15][16] Adherents view mainstream conservatives with ridicule and have been credited for originating and using the term \"cuckservative\",[1][2] a neologistic epithet described by some as racist.[17] Sources such as Newsday and the Cornell Review note the alt-right's strong opposition to both legal and illegal immigration, and their hardline stance on the European migrant crisis of 2015\u20132016.[5][7] Ethan Chiel, writing for Fusion, has described members of the alt-right as \"identity-obsessed\".[18] Members of the alt-right use social media and internet message boards such as 4chan and 8chan to share their beliefs.*\n\n[Here's someone intelligent *objectively* (oh he's tryin'!) discussing the movement based on his interactions with them.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cp0uq-QafYQ)\n\n**Why I think the Alt-right belongs in people's crosshairs as much as SJWs do:**\n\n- They're the other side of the same coin and there are many similarities between them. Spend enough time tracking down proponents of this ideology and you will find plenty of people just as extreme and radical in their beliefs as the radical third wave feminists and SJWs that they hate. Some of those beliefs may be the antithesis to corresponding beliefs on the same spectrum on the left (ie: determinism versus free will, the role of personal responsibility etc), some may be neutral with respect to the left (the Alt-right is a lot more progressive regarding technology than the \"old\" right and are less likely to deny climate change), and others are more at home on the extreme right (fear of \"white genocide\", Islamaphobia, hatred of immigrants/illegal immigration and refugees, white supremacism, nationalism, neoreactionary political stances often mirroring the established right, total rejection of academia, belief in \"cultural Marxism\" etc). \n\nI should add that the Alt-right attacks SJWs for festering in online safe spaces/echo chambers, the Alt-right does something similar with infamous message boards like 4chan and Stormfront (and parts of reddit like /r/theredpill, /r/The_Donald, /r/European among others) though the Alt-right is more of a broad spectrum where many proponents adopt some core beliefs and not others. \n\n- Like SJWs, it is a movement dominated by millennials. Unlike SJWs, most of the Alt-right are young white men. The less open criticism that exists of this ideology and the more room they are given to entertain this ideology, the more deeply entrenched these beliefs will become and the more they will have a sway in political discourse in the years to come. \n\n**Just to make it clear where I stand, the general progressive change that has come about as a result of public discourse is a categorically positive force in the world.** The Alt-right and SJWs alike represent is the pitfalls of exposing people who haven't developed the ability to think critically to long sessions with social media. I think the Alt-right and SJW movement alike are products of online echo chambers. Historically, people in their formative years, outside of rigorous religious or ideological indoctrination, would entertain these beliefs privately without constant validation by others. Today, young people get a large part of their identity from interactions with larger online groups where they end up in positive feedback loops riding out whatever their confirmation bias is to its natural conclusion, sometimes indefinitely, aided by whatever groups they identify with. This is amplified when done in isolation with little or no guidance. \n\nI think that we live in changing times and a byproduct of information being democratized is what gatekeepers it once had (teachers, intellectuals, academics, libraries, newspapers, the media etc), however fallible they were, are gone, and this democratization of information can be toxic to people who lack the critical thinking skills or life experience through which to process it. Without these skills people will just cling to that which satisfies their confirmation biases. Critical thinking is learned, it's not something we're born with and some people never bother to learn it. What this meant in the past is that people without this skill wouldn't have had the platform for their voice that they have today as to have a voice in the past meant one needed credentials, and while this wasn't perfect, it ensured for the most part that people who came out the other end were capable of some degree of critical thinking.\n\nLike many ideas you see on the internet, what SJWs believe are Bad Ideas that very few educated adults would entertain and these SJWs arrived at these conclusions by the same process that the Alt-right did. What most proponents of the Alt-right believes are also Bad Ideas, and in the past century many of these ideas were very much in vogue and the majority of intellectuals who've dealt with them over the past hundred years have concluded that they were categorically bad ideas that are partially responsible for the deaths of millions of people. \n\nOutside of the kind of large scale societal reform we desperately need, the only recourse people who don't belong to either of these camps have is to try and tackle these ideologies head on with (reasoned) words as we have a pretty good idea where they lead. The first step in doing so is identifying what these ideologies are, where they come from, who subscribes to them and why. Sympathy, too, in good measure. Downvotes and ad hominems won't do it. Walk them through how they arrived at these conclusions if you have to.\n\nThe reason I put this in CMV is because I'd like to be wrong in my assessment of the Alt-right and/or be shown that it isn't as big a force as I believe it is. I've followed politics for a long time and never felt that my generation would be polarized the same way that older generations are, but here we are. It makes me deeply uncomfortable as does the relative silence about it. \n\n**tl;dr** \n\nThe SJW  movement and \"regressive left\" has had a fair share of attention cast on it by reddit and the internet as a whole, however a lot of the people casting stones at the regressive left are leaning more and more to Alt-right (or new right) ideology. I think that this is the other side of the same coin and think more people need to pay attention to this ideology, who subscribes to it and why, as if it continues unchecked as it has been then it could potentially become a new source of extremism in the future that halts progress in the same way that contemporary political polarization does or worse.

Here are my grievances against The Donald (edit: these don't all have to do with him not being a conservative, but would still need to be addressed in order to convince me that a Trump nomination/presidency would not be a disaster):\n\n\n1. He has, in the past, donated vast amounts of money to several liberal politicians such as Hillary Clinton and Harry Reid.\n\n\n2. His success as a businessman has more to do with the hundreds of dollars of Manhattan real estate he inherited than his personal business ventures.\n\n\n3. His incredibly incendiary and offensive statements towards women, muslims, and hispanics have gone beyond making a statement against political correctness; they are just insulting.\n\n\n4. His entire campaign has run on no substance whatsoever. He makes up his policy as he goes along; and, as we could see from his recent statements on abortion, he just says what he thinks his supporters want to hear.\n\n\n5. Just because he \"thinks he's a conservative\" doesn't mean he is. He said that his sister, an extremely liberal judge, would make a good SCOTUS nominee.\n\n\n6. He has called for protesters at his rallies to be beaten.\n\n\n7. I understand that you're all angry. I'm angry too, and I want to burn the place down. But it's not a good idea to burn a house down *when you're living in it.*\n\n\n8. Last but not least (even though it's number eight, derp) if he is the GOP nominee, he will be the face of conservatism. The damage he will do to the public's perception of conservatives (which has already been heavily damaged by the GOP establishment) may be irreparable.\n\n\nHowever, many people support him; including a personal friend of mine, who is a very intelligent person, and spent a long time deciding who to support. Is it possible that all the Trump supporters know something I don't know?\n\n_____\n\n> *Hello, users of CMV! This is a footnote from your moderators.

            "selftext": "I believe that at the moment the current state of the world will only lead to rough conflicts, the festering of nasty ideologies and breakdowns in communication across all fronts. There are many root causes of this which I will go into further detail on below. Given the way matters have worsened over the last few months, I don't see how we'll ever be able to co-operative with each other on a large scale again.\n\nThe Refugee Crisis and Terrorism.\n\nOver the past few weeks, there has been a lack of willingness across Europe about what to do about the migrant crisis. Most countries simply wish to bury their head in the sand until it goes away. There has been no solid international plan put in place to either end the Syrian conflict, settle the migrants properly allowing them to settle properly in a host country in a way that's controlled and doesn't put too large of a burden on one particular nation, Everyone has seemed to adopt the policy of \"Not in my back yard\". The rise of ISIS and their horrific and deplorable attacks on Paris and Brussels only intensifies their lack of willingness to resolves this issue humanely. Fundamentally there needs to be some form of international co-operation to help these people and quell concerns of terrorism. I may fundamentally and seriously disagree with their views but I still think they have the right to be treated as human beings. \n\nWhich leads to another problem\n\nThe EU\n\nJust because Germany has born the brunt of the refugee crisis by allowing a large amount of refugees in other countries have taken it upon themselves to launch campaigns asking for a referendum to leave the EU. This fuels the agenda of people on the far right groups looking to demonise immigrants and refugees. Using ISIS to further this agenda and capitalise on this for political gain.\n\nDonald Trump\n\nA trend I've noticed as of late is a movement to attack \"political correctness\" to normalise certain morally questionable views and hide behind freedom of speech whenever it's opposed. Trump is thinly veiling his remarks about Mexicans, Muslims as a race and Women a bit to avoid directly conflicting with the First Amendment but it still just doesn't leave a good taste in the mouth. While I am totally for freedom of speech, I am against using it to justify incitement to hatred, violating the rules and morals of institutions and spreading nasty untruths by denying scientific and historic facts like climate change and in some cases ( like on 4chan/pol/) The Holocaust. Trump himself doesn't massively jump over this line but he inspires the behaviour to do it online and in public.  \n\nWhether he intends it or not he has become a beacon for this kind of behaviour. I am equally disappointed in the media for being sordid and relishing in the outrage in search of viewers and not debunking and condemning some of statements that Trump makes, an activity that I admire PolitiFact for. Clinton hasn't done enough to oppose this kind of behaviour and Sanders' fans seem to be adding fuel to the fire of Trump supporters. Both of them seem to be too preoccupied with scuffling amongst themselves in any case. \n\nThe Media\n\nThere are other concerns around media I have and the way they report certain issues such as highlighting nasty attitudes towards Disney for having a Stormtrooper in Star Wars who is black or a female lead character. They want you to be outraged, not saddened or feel a duty to say that it's wrong. \n\nGamergate is also a controversy I have serious issues with.\n\nEverywhere I turn I am disappointed in what we have become and lose hope in what we can achieve as a race. I'm not asking you to agree with me on every point but if you think I'm uninformed, don't see/approach these matters in the right way or have an overly bleak outlook please CMV. \n\n_____\n\n> *Hello, users of CMV!

            "selftext": "Lately I've been thinking about this election and how it shows just how flawed the last 25+ years of policy have been. So, I've been reading a lot about other countries' constitutions and legal systems to compare, and what I found is that many of the \"basic laws\" and constitutional documents (notably Germany) have a provision at the top that says human dignity and rights should be the basis of all law. \n\nThese provisions refer to Kant's idea of the Categorical Imperative, the idea that morality should be derived from pure practical philosophy rather than from observations of the effectiveness of various actions and precedents because they rely on moral intuitions rather than rational powers. To take an example, one might say theft is wrong because it diminishes the outcome for those involved in it. However, stealing might be moral for someone trying to maximize his own outcome by this yardstick. This is known as a hypothetical imperative. If you use a categorical imperative, which Kant advocates, the morality of actions is determined by whether you want it to become a universal law. The Golden Rule restated.\n\nAnyone with a slight background in American political thought knows that our Bill of Rights and separation of powers is based on hypothetical imperatives. \"Men are not angels\" wrote Madison in the Federalist Papers, so we need to delineate the boundaries where men can operate to ensure a stable outcome. In response to the Civil War, the 14th Amendment was ratified to respond to issues relating to former slaves. The relevant text is quoted here:\n\n> Section 1. All persons born or naturalized in the United States, and subject to the jurisdiction thereof, are citizens of the United States and of the State wherein they reside. No State shall make or enforce any law which shall abridge the privileges or immunities of citizens of the United States; nor shall any State deprive any person of life, liberty, or property, without due process of law; nor deny to any person within its jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws.\n\nWhile the text appears to make fundamental \"privileges and immunities\" part of US citizenship, there is, firstly, no account of what these privileges and immunities are. Indeed, this clause was [rendered practically null](https://www.law.cornell.edu/anncon/html/amdt14a_user.html#amdt14a_hd1) 5 years after its ratification during the \"Slaughter House Cases\", when the Supreme Court ruled that the Federal Government had no right to impede on the rights of the States to determine what these privileges and immunities were and how that statement should be interpreted. Thus began 150 years of open discrimination against racial, religious, and sexual minorities that continues to this day.\n\nBut say we did get around to imposing a national list of rights and privileges that superceded states' rights. It might be an exhaustive task to try and list every single privilege and immunity that has ever and could ever come up as our society rapidly changes. Therefore, maybe it would be wise to take a page from the German postwar constitution and impose an abstract general principle determined independently of all previous human action as the basis for a list of fundamental rights that will be quantified over time through practice.\n\nDue to the possibility of a Trump or Cruz presidency, not to mention the legacy of Jim Crow and the mass incarceration that continues to this day, it might be time to impose legal safeguards against outwardly or implicitly discriminatory agendas that could be voted in by a scared and manipulated public. I think human dignity and the golden rule is something everyone can agree on.\n\n_____\n\n> *Hello, users of CMV! This is a footnote from your moderators.

            "selftext": "Doing damage to the system and the bourgeois state by helping bring into power a candidate whose regime would be disastrous would be an effective strategy not only for the short term goal of getting a leftist into office four years from now and perhaps permanently disrupting and damaging the Republican Party, but also for the long term goal of revolutionary agitation among the working class to the end of building socialism.\n\nIt is plain that a Trump presidency would be a disaster. Not only does fiscal management of a capitalist enterprise not translate to fiscal management of a state, but Trump's record of fiscal management in the market is atrocious. Furthermore, his evident racism and covert white nationalism (evidenced by his nativist rhetoric in regards to Mexico and non-white immigration) would agitate a growing sector of the US against him and his government. Thirdly, his pro-bourgeois mentality and methods would cause further neglect and degradation of US public services and infrastructure and in all likelihood erosion of US power.\n\nHis presidency, therefore, if it occurred, would result in revolutionary agitation. The working classes whom he regards in contempt and the minorities whom he regards with vile malice would be primed towards the support of leftist candidates in the next election, which would in all likelihood be a democratic and left-democratic landslide and greatly damaging and disruptive to the reactionary-republicans' capabilities of fielding another effective opposition force for some time, possibly to the point of heralding a Seventh Party System. A solid south republican bloc ineffectively opposing a left-democratic New-Dealist state in the successful Sanders model. This stage on the road to socialism, of economic stimulus through public works and infrastructure, worker's rights, protectionism and a return to manufacturing, as well as the beginnings of both the vanguard party and directional centralism is vital in building the structures necessary to travel further on this path, like nationalization of vital industries, guaranteed employment, workplace collectivization, alleviating pressure on small proprietors, and agricultural mobilization.\n\n\n_____\n\n> *Hello, users of CMV!

            "selftext": "**TL;DR Whether your outsider candidate loses or not, you should support both in at least the hope that they can beat back the corruption in our political system, before it swallows our democracy whole and we never get a true peoples candidate ever again. Once our system is restored, then the next election we can vote truly on policy. but for now, this is strictly just to survive.**\n\nRegardless of how you feel toward either Donald Trump or Bernie Sanders, I believe they stand for something greater than either one of their most radical policies. Both are two candidates that (at least as far as anyone can tell) are willing to spit in the face of the elitist corporations puppeting of the government, and clean their hands of dirty political money. They will carry out their own interpretations of government policies, but more importantly will take measures to wrangle our political systems out of the influence of the corrupt and the obscenely wealthy.\n\nNow whether or not they truly hold this position as something they will fight for once elected, or whether it is just a big show to get them through the front doors I don't think we can truly know. But judging by the violent reactions from both ends of the spectrum in suppressing them, I am willing to believe their threats carry some weight.\n\nI also realize that the policies campaigned by both candidates are yin and yang respectively. It is a hefty request to ask which ever party might lose to their opponent shill to grit their teeth and support a candidate who might have spat in their flag runner's face not too long ago, and whose policies are night and day.\n\nBut whether your favorite candidate makes it to the general election or bites the dust, I feel one principle should be acknowledged. **We may very well never get an opportunity to push such bold candidates this far ever again.** The lengths to which both Bernie and Trump have pushed the system to show its true corruption speaks volumes as to how far they will go to maintain power.\n\nOn Bernie's side, legislation that had limited Hilary's donation cap for all candidates on how much contributors can donate was abolished easily; that was with her being bashed hard and not even in a position of power. Imagine what things could be done with a complete puppet like Ted or Hilary in the hot seat with at least 4 years of time. We could be walled off to the point where we were truly a democracy in name alone (if we aren't already)\n\n**Which brings me to the true point of this post.** I get that both candidates are bizarro versions of each other, and you will hate the policies that might abound from the candidate opposite of you. But a point could be argued that so long as either of them keep their word in restoring our election system to a respectable state, that whatever policies they might induct would be a drop in the bucket compared to the lasting repercussions of letting our democracy slip away for ever.\nThat even if the policies they enact are terrible and flat out fail, at least we could have **the real** election next election cycle, where we vote on policy and not for survival.\n\nBecause that is what this year really is. About our survival as a democracy. And whether you think one of the candidates is a left-wing communist, or the other is a right-wing extreme nationalist, any damage they could incur in worst case scenarios is outweighed by the loss the American public would feel in having their votes truly reduced to ash. \n\nThank you for your time in reading the wall of text, and I would love to hear your opinion on this topic.\n\nEDIT: Mistakenly put \"next year\", not \"next election cycle\".

Now currently, a huge amount of the republican elites are supporting Cruz over Trump but to me, he seems like he'd be much worse than Trump, though I definitely do not support Trump. To begin with, Trumps ideas are entirely implausible, meaning I don't picture him succeeding in passing anything he's proposed through congress. This means while he would be ineffectual, as long as he had semi competent advisors he wouldn't destroy the US like some people claim. On the other hand, Cruz has shown an utter lack of respect for the government, famously leading a 21 hour filibuster in opposition to the Affordable Care Act and willingly shutting down the government, calling it a \"great success\". He has also vowed to repeal Obamacare, denying 24 million people healthcare while not proposing a valid alternative. This personally seems more detrimental to the US than a president that will simply be ineffective. Finally, his ultra religious stance appears much more hurtful than Trump, potentially undoing the LGBTQ+ progress this country has made while also not representing a huge part of the country that isn't ultra religious. Be great to hear any potential positives of him or why Trump would be worse. \n\n_____\n\n> *Hello, users of CMV! This is a footnote from your moderators.

The only way he could win at that point would be if enough superdelegates defect to him to give him the lead. This is entirely undemocratic and it overrides the will of the people. As someone who is running under the guise of being someone who is supported by the people, this would be undemocratic and hypocritical of Bernie.\n\n2. If he does steal the nomination from her by using superdelegates, it would be terrible for party unity against whomever the GOP nominates. Instead of spending the time between the last primaries and the convention consolidating the base and reunifying the party, Bernie will be alienating a huge portion of democrats who are more moderate and don't support his views, as well as Clinton supporters who will feel the nomination was stolen. This is akin to the GOP \"establishment\" stealing the election from Trump in terms of backlash.\n\n3. It's been tradition that despite the superdelegates supporting one candidate throughout primary season, they will end up unifying behind the person who gets the most pledged delegates. In 08, Hillary's superdelegates went to Obama when it was clear he was going to win. For Bernie to do the opposite and try to take superdelegates who support the person who was democratically chosen would be going against the precedent that's been established.\n\nI would also say the same thing about Hillary if Bernie gets the majority of pledged delegates and the popular vote and she used her superdelegates to win. It just seems like that probably won't be the case AND she didn't do that in the past with Obama. ",

Unfortunately, I have not been so diligent in my followings of Mr. Trump.  \n\nTomorrow (Mon) I will be attending one of Trump's rallies here I'm my home town of Buffalo, NY and feel quite uninformed about Trump over all.

So hears what I ask of you, although in essence I am asking for you to change my view of what the general media has lead me to believe.

            "selftext": "Throughout the fattening and the entire debate about free speech on reddit, some argued that reddit had an obligation to protect free speech, and others parroted that one [XKCD comic](https://xkcd.com/1357/)\n\nBut I was not convinced that this was just a matter of reddit having the right to decide what it allows on its site, or a matter of the community \"showing you the door.\" Imgur's admins outright banned FPH content, and Reddit's admins banned the subreddit.\n\nMilo Yiannopoulos (*sigh* yes I know) pointed out that most of the discourse and communication on the internet is on social networks like reddit, Facebook, Twitter, and so on. Of course you are allowed to make *your own* website and say whatever you want on it, but you can't reasonably expect to be satisfied with that. The point of free speech is that you want to be *heard.* \n\n[This](http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/apr/19/donald-trump-facebook-election-manipulate-behavior) article put the nail in the coffin for me. Simply suggesting such a thing is very threatening, and it made me realize that XKCD was a bit short sited on the matter. Most of us, I assume, agree that corporations \"donating\" massive amounts of money to politians to gain political power is corrupt and should be illegal, I think we should also consider that social networks, as worldwide platforms for communication and expression should have an obligation to interfere as little as possible with its users right to free speech. \n\n\nThe definition of free speech must be revised. It isn't a slippery slope when I say social networks and other websites can easily manipulate information and by extension, public opinion, simply by suppressing certain keywords and users. The above article outlines exactly how possible it is. ",

            "selftext": "I hate Trump. I hate his racist remarks, his attitude toward women and the disabled, his cockiness, and his treatment of his fellow candidates. But what I hate more than all of that, is a liar. \n\nI'm an independent who has switched to Democrat to vote for Obama (a decision I deeply regret) and i am a current supporter for Sanders.\n\nLet me put it this way: if my candidate loses to the shadow games, dirty tricks, and big money of Clinton, then I'm done playing nice. Trump, to me, embodies Bernie Sanders' message of no more traditional politics, but in a much more aggressive and violent way.\n\nLincoln may have freed the slaves, but he was still racist in his own right. Jefferson owned slaves of his own. FDR and Trumanand were despicable to Japanese Americans, as well as the victims of Hiroshima. Polk was awful in forcing the Navajo from their home. And then there's the Clintons... whose their crime bill had monumentally horrible repercussions for young African Americans.\n\nMy point is, American Presidents having faults in philosophy and ethics is nothing new. Having these faults lead to catastrophe for one group of people or another is nothing new.\n\nThe difference with Trump is, we know where he stands, and what we would be getting. Also, we know he won't be able to accomplish these things at all. He is up front with his faults and biases, which I think is more than fair. Hillary Clinton, however, is Machiavellian. She has no biases, other than seeing herself in power.  She could pass some other disastrous trade deal that would send jobs over seas. She could Crack down on the war on drugs and bring more harm to young African Americans. She is more of a warhawk than some Republicans, and would cause much worse than Benghazi. But we don't know. We don't know how many groups of people will be in harms way for her to get what she wants. \n\nI could see Trump actually being able to have Muslims register themselves. I could see him bringing back waterboarding and other torturous interrogation techniques. I could even see him building a wall, and having a plan to have Mexico pay for it. We know all this up front. But mass deportation of Illegal immigrants? That will not happen. He would be blocked so quickly it's not even funny. The sheer cost in regards to money and manpower for such a feat is absurd, nobody would agree to it. This is the one thing I see him wanting to do, but not being able to. \n\nWe know what he is up front, and therefore, we know what we can fight him on.\n\nOn the other hand, he's against the TPP, NAFTA, and other trade deals that shipped millions of American jobs over seas. He's a master deal maker, who I think could pay out our debt and bolster the economy immensely, and improve our relationship with China and other manufacturer nations. \n\nHe's also beholden to nobody but himself. His vision of America is his own, not some corporation's. Hillary Clinton has so many different visions of America, it's hard to know which one she wants to actually implement. She also is constantly defending the affordable care act, which I think is convoluted and needs to be replaced. She would be bad for the economy.\n\nI see Trump doing MASSIVE social damage to our nation and it's image. But I also see him doing MASSIVE good for businesses, manufacturing, our debt, and our trade partners.\n\nI see Hillary doing MASSIVE damage in BOTH areas, and yet nobody will be able to see it coming, so we will be completely flanked by her dangerous pragmatism.\n\n\n\nHere's my point.\n\nThe whole world knows what Trump is going to try and do, and so we won't be easily blindsided. We, and everyone else, can combat him on the bad ideas, and reap the benefits of his good ones. Congress and the Supreme Court won't let him get half as far as he wants to go. If you know your enemy, you can defeat him. If you know what your opponent is trying to do, you can anticipate and defend.\n\n Clinton is shrouded in mystery and drowning in corporate influence. She will easily blindside the country with another disastrous bill that will cause tremendous harm. But with Trump, we know what's coming, so we can brace ourselves for impact, and therefore mitigate the damage.\n\nI don't want either one. But I would rather vote for an honest racist who wants to do some good for the country, than a \"progressive\" liar who wants only good for herself. I would rather let a wolf in, than a Wolf in sheep's clothing. \n\nI would rather watch our country burn itself alive honestly, than bury itself under private interests and greed.",

            "selftext": "Sure, their aesthetic is trashy. That much is pretty obvious. And of course the Gathering of the Juggalos is a *literal* cesspit, complete with Lake Hepatitis. And obviously their music is... not great, to be charitable (I actually don't hate their beats, they just don't have a good flow and have the dumbest lyrics I have ever heard in rap, *which is saying something*).\n\nBut, honestly, I got kind of curious about who they were as people, and... they legitimately seem like really nice, fun people. Hell, the way they explain their Dark Carnival mythology is basically the most hippie interpretation of Judeo-Christian cosmology possible short of \"there is no Hell\" (if you're generally decent, you go to Heaven, if you're a shithead, you go to Hell, literally nothing else matters). Violent J hates the fuck out of racists and is a devoted family man. I couldn't really find anything of interest about Shaggy 2 Dope's personal life beyond \"he's 3 years sober\" but, given the company he apparently keeps, I'm inclined to think he's not terribly different.\n\nI can't even really hold their music against them, because it's pretty obvious their first love is wrestling, and they're... kinda okay at wrestling (I've only seen them in an ECW bit off the top of my head, but they took bumps from Rob Van Dam and Sabu really well and that's a solid amount of the job right there).\n\nEven the Gathering itself and the Juggalo deal could be taken as a positive thing, frankly; these people would be in horrible, desperate situations with or without ICP, and at least ICP's giving them something other than white power to hang on to. Even if they're pretty awful rappers, I think I'd rather see the redneck hordes latch on to two chill people in clown makeup who like wrestling and B-movies, than someone like Donald Trump, you know?\n\n_____\n\n> *Hello, users of CMV!

            "selftext": "It would have been more satisfying for me to say \"in American history\" or \"ever\" but because the antebellum years are fraught with so much baggage about slavery and secessionist behavior, and since the norms of the modern political system are so different, I figured I'd moderate myself.\n\nI am defining \"worst\" here as most unfit to be president, although I believe he would also harm the GOP from an electoral standpoint and damages the reputation of the party nationally and the US globally. \n\nI am basing my assessment off of Drumpf's words and actions (i.e., please spare me any speculation that \"he is a deal-maker so once he wins the nomination/presidency he will transform himself into a hyper-competent centrist\"). \n\nMy argument can be summarized as such:\n\n1. He would be the worst nominee in terms of governing experience. Every previous nominee either held elected office in the federal government, as governor of a state*, or was a high-ranking military commander. This means Drumpf would be completely unfamiliar with how the US government functions, including how to conduct public policy, foreign affairs, and military action.\n\n2. His distasteful personal conduct is at a level unseen in the modern political era (at least since WWI). He regularly insults people openly, advocates or condones violence by his supporters, flirts with misogyny and racism, discusses political issues without any sense of restraint, forethought, or seriousness, and he swears at his rallies a lot. This is un-presidential and speaks to an unhinged personal style unfit for governing the US. \n\n3. He demonstrates little knowledge of or inclination to learn about policy issues, does not \"hire the best people\" to be his advisers, and constantly changes or lies about his past positions, sometimes over the course of a day. \n\n4. The policies that he has advocated for would be either unfeasible or disastrous for this country (or, if you want to be more \"objective\" about this measure: he has advocated for more policies that are significantly outside of mainstream American political thought). These include policies like: \n\n- building a border wall that Mexico will pay for (which amounts to essentially deconstructing NAFTA), \n\n- ending US free trade agreements and starting a trade war with China, \n\n- banning Muslims from entering the US and monitoring them in a database on the basis of their religion, \n\n- deconstructing the post-WWII national security apparatus by defunding NATO and our military commitments with South Korea/Japan, \n\n- implementing massive tax cuts without any significant spending cuts proposed,\n\n- the list goes on\n\nThis combination of features makes him at best, wildly unpredictable as a president, and at worst, the most disastrous person who has held the office since the United States was literally dissolved as a unified country for 4 years. \n\nI may add to/edit my points but will make note of where I do this. \n\nCMV\n\n_____\n\n> *Hello, users of CMV!

            "selftext": "Points that contribute to my view:\n\n1. No other race is expected to cast white people. This applies worldwide; if someone in India makes a Spider-Man movie, even though white people created Spider-Man, the Indian Spider-Man is Indian, and no one (including me) protests this. I know the counter-argument is that white people are more \"powerful\" and they already get cast a lot, but I feel like this is paternalistic and reeks of white superiority. White people should not be burdened with representing other cultures when those cultures have absolutely no equivalent burden of representing white culture.\n\n2. I've been told that casting should not be \"colorblind,\" because race matters. If race matters and cultures' histories and contributions matter, it should be noted that white people created movies and started the Hollywood system. Of course Hollywood is going to cast mostly white people. No one complains that most rappers are black and most sitar players are Indian. No one complains that the NBA is 75% black in a country that is only 12% black. Only white people seem to have this particular complaint levied at them. (Please note that \"white people have other advantages\" is not a counter-argument here). \n\n3. White writers should not have the burden of telling other cultures' stories thrust upon them. If you aren't black or Asian or hispanic, etc., people are going to question why you are writing characters of these races and demand black, Asian, hispanic, etc. writers to accurately tell their stories. This will displace even more people from their jobs when they are guilty of nothing more than having the wrong skin color. I was raised to believe this is the wrong way to judge people. \n\n4. It's flat-out racist. No one should be denied work because of the color of their skin. It doesn't matter whether they are a majority or a minority, it's the wrong way to judge people. \n\n5. \"White people have power\" is the wrong way to judge people. Just because some white people have power, you should not apply this to all white people. I grew up around poor white people (\"poor white trash,\" according to most of society) who have no money, no power, no say in the world, and very little say in their own lives, even. They've been in and out of jail for things I would get a slap on the wrist for (just like minorities), and some of them still don't have access to basic healthcare, healthy food, and the internet (also like many minorities). \"White people have power because they are white\" is a very difficult argument for me to swallow and is, to me, the same as saying \"a black guy stole my bike, therefore black people are bicycle thieves.\" If the latter is wrong, so is the former.\n\n6. It's condescending. Hollywood movies are becoming \"Targeting Racial Demographics: the Movie\". I hardly think Hollywood can be blamed for this, because what is being asked of them makes little sense, therefore their response can't be expected to make much sense. \n\n7. Hollywood is not responsible for telling your story. You are responsible for telling your story. If you have a phone that records video and an internet connection, you are not locked out of the storytelling process anymore. Yes, you will have to work your ass off, but believe or not so did Scarlett Johansson and many other white people who have been told that they shouldn't be able to do certain work because of the color of their skin. \n\nNow before you dismiss me as just some dumb angry Trump voter, let me tell you some of my other beliefs, which you have to understand can coexist with the beliefs above. I believe Hillary should be the next president, but Sanders would be my second choice. I believe black people have been treated disgustingly unfairly by American society and deserve reparations in the form of monetary payments. I believe in full equality for LGBT people, and think progress still needs to be made for it to exist. I believe in a higher minimum wage. I believe the Washington Redskins should change their name. I believe we should accept Muslim refugees. \n\nAnd here's one thing I don't believe: I don't believe movies should deliberately cast white people because of their race. I believe filmmakers of all races should be able to cast whoever they want. (Quentin Tarantino tends to do a good job of this.) \n\nI believe that a person should be judged on the content of his or her character and not the color of his or her skin (MLK), and that the color of a person's skin should have no more significance than the color of their eyes (H. Selassie). \n\nChange my view. \n\n_____\n\n> *Hello, users of CMV! This is a footnote from your moderators. We'd just like to remind you of a couple of things.

            "selftext": "Donald Trump, no matter how much you like him or hate him, is a gift to democracy in the United States. Donald is a radical, anti-establishment, independent (yes, I understand he is running as a Republican) candidate. Trump has made it all over the media, and in our internet conversations. I can not go one day without Trump trending on Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, and other social media. Trump has influenced many people to pay attention to politics. Mainly because Trump is entertaining. So many people are finally realizing the corruption in establishment politics and in today's political climate. Trump has gotten the word out. In high schools, colleges, workplaces, family gatherings, hangouts with friends, Trump is everywhere. He has gotten so much attention on social media, that people actually (maybe) want to know what is happening in politics. Donald Trump has made many of my friends and family who didn't know a thing about government and politics actually interested. Personally, i've been involved for a while, but none of my friends have. With Trump in the news all the time, people want to vote. Voter turnout in some primaries are at an all time high. People know who all the candidates are. People who the BS Hillary has committed. People know who Ted Cruz, and (maybe) John Kasich. People are waking up and realizing the corruption in politics. This is why people are angry when Bernie loses. That is why people are paying attention. People are waking up and paying attention to the elections. I believe this all because of Donald Trump, and Bernie Sanders (that's a story for another time).\nDonald Trump is a gift to democracy.\n\nEdit: Disclaimer: I do not, I repeat, DO NOT, support Donald Trump.\n_____\n\n> *Hello, users of CMV!

            "selftext": "**Closed elections are not undemocratic.**\n\nI argue that Sanders and his supporters are using selective argumentation to prove that Clinton is only winning the Democratic primaries due to closed elections. I argue that Clinton\u2019s ability to win closed primaries is not because of the lack of independent voters, but because of her more diverse base of supporters in terms demographics in the states that held closed primaries.\n\nThis discussion pertains to the current 2016 U.S. Democratic primaries. Recently, Bernie Sanders and his supporters have been increasingly critical of the current Democratic primary system, particularly closed elections. Though, the Democratic primaries run various types of elections throughout the primary season besides closed elections.\n\nBefore we get into the discussion, here are some information on U.S. primary elections for those who don\u2019t know:\n\n*What are closed elections?*\n\n* **Closed elections** are elections where only people registered as members of a certain party can vote in that primary. Independents and registered members of other parties like the Republican Party are not allowed to vote. This is in direct contrast to open elections.\n\n* This is in contrast to **open elections** where everyone is allowed to vote, regardless of party affiliation or lack thereof.\n\nThere are other types of elections such as semi-closed elections and semi-open elections:\n\n* **Semi-closed elections** allow party members and unaffiliated voters to vote, leaving out people from other parties.\n\n* **Semi-open elections** are pretty much open elections except that unlike open elections where voters are given a ballot and on the ballot they choose which party to vote for, in semi-open elections, voters must declare party they wish to vote for and are then given a party-specific ballot. For all intents and purposes, semi-open elections are essentially open elections.\n\n\nFurthermore, elections are either primaries or caucuses. These types of elections do not pertain to who can participate in the election, but rather how elections are conducted. Primaries are essentially normal elections while caucuses are town hall meetings where delegates who support the same candidate group up and whichever candidate has the most support wins.\n\nClosed elections have been a staple of both Democratic and Republican primaries for years. Once upon a time, all party elections were closed. In fact, back then, nominees were not chosen by the people in an election, but instead they were chosen in a single National convention by party leaders only. Things have changed. Parties now host elections open to normal people. This is due to the fact that the old system was simply undemocratic and it sometimes led to unelectable people being chosen as the nominees. Elections open to normal people is an easy way to determine if a candidate is electable or not. However, state parties are given the choice on whether to run a closed, open, semi-closed, and semi-open election. Closed elections have been a part of the primary process for years and have not really been a huge issue until this election. And it wasn\u2019t until the New York Democratic primary where the issue really became controversial.\n\n*What is the purpose of closed elections?*\n\n* The purpose of closed elections is to keep outsiders out. The reason for this is the belief that only true supporters of a party know who would best represent them.\n\n* There is also a fear of saboteurs or \u201craiders\u201d from other parties that might purposely vote for weaker candidates to make the election easier for their preferred candidate from other parties. Though this occurrence is rare, it has happened before recently. In 2008, Rush Limbaugh pushed Republican voters to vote for Hillary Clinton over Barack Obama because Barack Obama was seen as the stronger candidate. In 2012, Democratic voters in Michigan voted in the Republican primary for Rick Santorum in an effort to prevent the nomination of Mitt Romney, who was seen as the stronger candidate.\n\n*Why have closed elections become so controversial?*\n\n* **Bernie Sanders** is a major candidate for the Democratic Presidential nomination, he is currently second place in pledged delegates. He tends to be more popular among independents than current Democratic frontrunner Hillary Clinton. Because independents are locked out of closed elections, supposedly a large part of his potential voters are locked out, leading many to believe that closed elections are undemocratic.\n* Because closed elections only allow party members to vote, closed elections tend to favor party favorites. The current party favorite is **Hillary Clinton**, who tends to be more popular among Democratic Party members. As a result, she stands most to gain by having closed elections.\n\nThere are several problems with this argument:\n\nThe most obvious being that Clinton has won 10/13 open primaries so far (11/14 if you count semi-open primaries). The most common counter to this point is that most of those primaries were in the Deep South, which are usually conservative and don\u2019t vote Democrat anyway. There are several problems with this counterpoint is that:\n\n* First off, such a dismissal unfairly diminishes the results of the battleground states that held open primaries. Only two battleground states held an open primary and that was Ohio (semi-open) and Virginia, both of which were won by Hillary Clinton. If we consider independents as undecided voters or voters in the middle who can swing elections as they usually do, naturally, they would be more influential and more numerous in the swing states. If there were places that the supposed independent voting bloc that Sanders always touts about could have swung elections his way it was those two states. They didn\u2019t.\n\n* Secondly, the idea that the South is conservative and therefore categorically against Sanders is a fundamental misunderstanding of the Southern electorate, a mistake that has led to the rise of Trump in the South and has led to Sanders tremendous losses there. **The South may be socially conservative, but they are not fiscally conservative.**\n\n* Why do you think Trump won a large part of the Deep South? Was it because Southerners are just racist and hate immigrants? No, it\u2019s his economic policies that attracted Southerners. Early on, he called for taxes to decrease on the poor and taxes to increase on the wealthy (though this is a lie or truth, depending on who you ask). He called for keeping Medicare and Social Security at a time when Republicans were calling for them to be cut. He called for a replacement of Obamacare with something similar to Canada\u2019s healthcare system. These are leftist economic views that Sanders touts. Southerners are predominantly working class whites and blacks who stand most to gain from Sanders policies.\n\n* Perhaps it was because he\u2019s socially liberal? Then what is Clinton? A gun-loving racist? They\u2019re basically the same in terms of socially liberal values. His failure to reach them stems from his inability to connect with those voters personally, which Clinton achieves by appealing to the blacks.\n\n* If anything, Clinton\u2019s ability to win in the Deep South is a testament to her diverse electorate and, thus, her superior electability compared to Sanders. This attitude that Sanders and his supporters are taking in dismissing the South as \u201cdistorting reality\u201d is a defeatist attitude that haunts Sanders even in the Northeastern states that Sanders likes to tout about. Why do you think minorities in the Northeastern states, especially blacks, vote overwhelmingly in favor of Clinton? Are they socially and fiscally conservative? Or are they just more attracted to Clinton than Sanders on a personal level?\n\n\nThe second most obvious hole in Sanders\u2019 argument is that Sanders has won 6/9 closed caucuses so far (6/7 if you only count states). If it really were the case that Clinton has a much bigger advantage in closed elections than in open elections, wouldn\u2019t closed caucuses basically be the ultimate advantage for Clinton? If we consider the argument that closed primaries limiting the potential amount of voters are an advantage for Clinton, surely a closed caucus, which drastically results in a low amount of voters, would give an even bigger advantage to Clinton? This is not the case. Strangely enough, in some of the most fiscally conservative states Sanders has swept closed caucuses. The only closed caucuses Clinton has won was in Nevada, a swing state, and the American Samoa and the Northern Marianas. It\u2019s obvious to see why a place like deeply liberal Maine would vote for Sanders. Though it\u2019s amazing to see that deeply fiscally conservative places like Wyoming, Alaska, Nebraska, and Kansas would vote for Sanders. Aren\u2019t they fiscally conservative strongholds, directly opposite to Sanders views? If we examine Sanders and his supporters\u2019 argument that conservatism, more specifically fiscal conservatism, is his biggest weakness which led to his blowouts in the South, then why doesn\u2019t this argument apply to actually fiscally conservative places like these states? One counterpoint would be that because elections are closed only real hardline liberals would be registered Democrats in such fiscally conservative states. But why can such hardline liberals only sprout in these places and not places like New York? Surely there are hardline liberals registered as Democrats in those states? The real reason why such states voted heavily in favor of Sanders is because of **their lack of diversity, a.k.a. their overwhelming non-Hispanic white population.**\n\n* The states of Wyoming, Alaska, Nebraska, Kansas, and even the swing state of Colorado, are heavily white. Heavier than other closed election states like New York and Maryland. When you compare the results of these two groups of closed election states and their demographics, it becomes easy to see why Sanders ultimately lost those states. New York, in particular, is \u201conly\u201d 56.5% non-Hispanic white as opposed to Colorado\u2019s 70% non-Hispanic White population. When you remember that minorities vote heavily in favor of Clinton, which comprise 43.5% of New York, and whites are typically split between young and old, it\u2019s easy to see that Clinton, compared to Sanders, has a huge advantage over Sanders in terms of diversity and broadness in her voter base. The split between young and old whites is less of an issue in heavily white states because inevitably there are more young white voters than old white voters. However, that split becomes an issue when you add minorities, especially blacks into the equation. Minorities staunchly in support of Clinton, young and old. That staunch support along with the split in whites is winning Clinton the primaries.\n\n* This is the same story in Maryland where non-Hispanic whites only comprise 52.6% of the population. Clinton won even harder in Maryland than in New York (63% vs. 57%). Contrary to popular belief, open primaries would not have saved Sanders from either demographic nightmare. Unsurprisingly, Clinton\u2019s struggled as white population increased, winning Pennsylvania by only 55% and 78% non-Hispanic white, Connecticut by 51% and 69% white. Clinton\u2019s lost Rhode Island, 74.5% non-Hispanic White.\n\n\nThe third hole in his argument is that independents are only heavily influential in swing states. The idea that independent voters will have a bigger impact in deep blue states than swing states contradicts the idea of what an independent voter is. If we go back to my first argument that independent voters are the ones that decide results in battleground states the most, wouldn\u2019t it be natural that they would comprise a higher percentage of the electorate in the swing states than in the red and blue states? If the supposed independent bloc are the ones pushing Sanders above Clinton, why didn\u2019t he win swing states with open primaries? More importantly, why wasn\u2019t he even competitive in them? He was blown out in both Virginia and Ohio. Was it because of demographics? Yes and no. Virginia is 63% non-Hispanic white whereas Ohio is 80% non-Hispanic white. Virginia can be chalked up to another demographic nightmare. Ohio on the other hand is peculiar. Why would an 80% non-Hispanic white state that had an open (semi-open) primary vote for Clinton. It\u2019s a swing state, too, meaning that there are more independent voters than normal. **The answer could very well be Sanders is not as popular among independent as he or his supporter like you to believe.** Sanders is certainly more popular among independents compared to Clinton. That\u2019s no question, the polls all show it and the primary results speak for themselves. But we must re-examine the polls. Clinton, despite being so \u201cunpopular\u201d among independents still leads Trump and Cruz in the polls. Despite having less popularity than Sanders among independents, she still pulls enough of their support as well as the staunch support of minorities and traditional Democrats to give her the edge over Sanders. Sanders was given two free shots at proving his cross-cutting appeal by winning the open primaries of Ohio and Virginia and he was blown out.\n\nThe real reason why Sanders is losing closed primaries is not because of the lack of independent voters, it\u2019s because of his narrow voter base compared to Clinton. Think about it. Sanders has only been successful in heavily non-Hispanic white states, whether open, closed, semi-open, or semi-closed. The only really diverse that he\u2019s won so far is Michigan, which is still 75.6% non-Hispanic white, a far cry from 56% and 52% shown by New York and Maryland. The idea that an open primary could\u2019ve saved Sanders is not only preposterous, it\u2019s insulting to the minorities who still staunchly support Clinton. Perhaps, states like Pennsylvania and Connecticut could\u2019ve been won by Sanders had they been open. They\u2019re mostly white, the demographics fit it. If anything, the fact that they\u2019re not swing states, makes it even easier for Sanders. But that\u2019s just it. If his greatest strength is his so-called independent bloc, **why can\u2019t he win a state like Ohio or Virginia?** Don\u2019t forget Nevada or Florida. Nevada was Clinton\u2019s only win in the closed causes in mainland United States. Unsurprisingly, that was the least whitest of the closed caucuses: 51.5% non-Hispanic white. Florida, a closed primary is 55% non-Hispanic white. Do you people honestly think Sanders had a chance in hell of winning those primaries with those demographics? Get out.\n\nIn short, I guess I didn't prove that closed elections were undemocratic. But I sought to prove that the reasons that Sanders' supporters had for why they are undemocratic are just invalid.\n\nChange my view.\n\n_____\n\n> *Hello, users of CMV!

As it stands, I don't really like any of the presidential candidates. Trump is obviously horrendous. I don't like Cruz based on his socially (and some fiscal) conservative ideals, and I don't trust him at all based on his interviews. He seems to use religion to pander to the masses of conservatives. Hillary is untrustworthy as well imo. I guess she's a good politician, but I don't necessarily trust her or agree with her most of the time. Bernie is a cool guy, but I don't think he's a strong enough leader/politician to be president, nor do I necessarily agree with his ideas -- they're a bit too socialist (and unrealistic, imo). I guess I could always vote for a third-party candidate, but \n\n1) I don't know enough about them to be able to say I'd want them as a president (that's my bad though. I guess I could always learn more about them.)\n\nBut the main reason is that \n\n2) It's pointless considering the fact that **third party candidates don't win**. I know if everyone thought like that it'd be dangerous to the political system, but based on political history, let's be honest -- at this point, they would never win anyways.\n\nIn conversations about the abysmal state of politics and how none of the candidates are really that great, I've mentioned to two different groups of friends that I might just refrain from voting, and they both flipped out on me. They told me it's my civic duty to vote, I should just vote for the least of the four evils, it's a disservice to myself and others if I don't participate, etc.\n\nI'm just like, why should I lend my vote to a person that I don't truly feel would make a good president? By not participating, I'm saying I don't support any of these candidates. Besides, I feel like local elections are the ones that truly make a difference. \n\nCMV, yall. \n\n(Also I don't really want to argue about any of the candidates and their abilities/stances/pros/cons.

However, the only reason he was able to ever make himself anything in business was family fortune and his self promotion as a product himself. And even then, he failed to make his brand that successful. It is simply chance and previous family money that allowed him to become known, and once being highlighted briefly in the media, used that to become a persona and product that he is now through Apprentice/Celebrity Apprentice and now Republican candidate for POTUS. There is no proof that he actually has true business savviness, at least to the level in which he claims and would make him a good leader. One might make the argument because he was able to do what he has, that it shows good business sense, but I am arguing that he simply relied on a million dollar loan and name recognition, not actual understanding of economic forces, risk assessment etc.\n\n_____\n\n> *Hello, users of CMV!

            "selftext": "My view is that if you want to give trump a negative \"trump style\" nickname, **Touchy Trump** is the best. \n\nYou may know that Trump puts a lot of importance on the nicknames he makes to brand his opponents. He looks for nicknames that 1) Reinforce an existing negative aspect of a candidate, 2) are catchy and visual. Examples include Low Energy Jeb (so anytime Jeb wasn't loud it got reinforced), Little Marco (same idea + Marco was shorter than him), Lyin' Ted, etc. Here's a post Scott Adams wrote on it: http://blog.dilbert.com/post/127715904536/trump-persuasion-alert-the-bush-slayer-comment\n\nI think it calls to mind Trump's insecurity and some of his weird habits. Examples include his being obsessed with his small hands, his germaphobia (he dislikes shaking hands, is obsessive about hand sanitizer), the way negative remarks get under his skin.\nSince he has a reputation as someone who is emotionally unpredictable, it seems like people will be reminded of his capricious personality every time he changes his mind.\n\nIt also downplays him as a serious candidate - which is a thought a lot of people have on their minds already.\n\nBasically, if anyone can find a negative nickname for Trump that is catchier and more effective than Touchy Trump, my view will be changed.\n\n_____\n\n> *Hello, users of CMV!

            "selftext": "With Trump likely to be the Republican nominee against Hillary, many seem to be already writing off the GOP's chances for 2016 and are looking ahead to how they might mount a comeback in 2020. (Please note that I am aware that there remain considerable variables between now and November that might get Trump to eke out a win).\n\nThe assumption that suggests the GOP doesn't stand much of beating Hillary in 2020 stem from several observations. The first is that the Republican party regardless of the election result is likely to remain in a state of civil war between the party Establishment who wants to pivot the party away from social issues and moderate the party's image, hardline Tea Party members in Congress who will continue to assert that the GOP will continue to lose unless they get a \"true conservative\" candidate like Cruz to rally behind, and a third bloc of Trump supporters opposed to free trade and neoliberal economics that have been the Republicans bread and butter since Reagan. Few are expecting the GOP to unite in time behind an electable candidate that can succeed in broadening the tent and winning over some of the minority voter blocs that comprise the Democrats coalition. While the Dems aren't immune to populist insurgents like Sanders, they are still in a far stronger position to coast through Hillary's first term and present themselves to the public as the party of safe, sensible government with a loyal voter base compared to the \"Republican clown car\" whose own voter base is in complete revolt. While some predict the RNC will overhaul their nomination process to make it easier for a moderate candidate to gain the nomination such as implementing the Dems superdelegate system, it may not be enough to overcome what is clearly very strong backlash by Republican voters against the party leadership.\n\nSecond, in regards to the aforementioned \"broadening the tent\", quite a few people believe there will be long-term repercussions  if Trump is the nominee since the Dems would constantly reference his candidacy and rhetoric to paint the entire Republican Party as the \"Party of Trump\" and all the negative images that entails, thus ensuring Hispanics and other minorities the Republicans need to outreach towards will continue to vote Democrat for the foreseeable future. Plus ensuring that a moderate like Nikki Haley or Brian Sandoval running in 2020 will be tainted by association since the Dems will constantly reference Trump's nomination to cast doubt on the Republicans ever \"turning a new leaf\".\n\nAnd third, elections have historically favored the incumbent candidate. The last four presidents in the modern era to have lost their re-election bids, Hoover, Ford, Carter, and H.W. Bush all owed their defeats to recession, scandal or some outside force. The Depression for Hoover, the fallout from Watergate and anti-Washington sentiment for Ford, Iran, stagflation, Ted Kennedy and the Reagan Revolution for Carter, and Ross Perot for Bush Sr. While some are predicting the next recession to occur sometime in the next few years, it is unlikely to have the same effect that the Great Recession of '07-'08 did for Bush's presidency, much less impair Hillary's chances at re-election. And the scandal card likely won't work since the GOP have been trying to implicate Hillary for for years and she's gotten away without a scratch. I certainly don't see Sanders or any other Democrat trying to primary Hillary in 2020 as Ted Kennedy did to Carter in '80 or another surge of Republican support like Reagan.\n\nBased on this, while I don't believe that this election and Trump's nomination will spell the \"doom of the GOP\" as many have been predicting, it doesn't appear that they will be re-taking the White House anytime soon, much less 2020 due to the factors mentioned above. Combined with the present demographic trends all favoring the Democrats and the upcoming round of redistricting likely to favor them due to the 2020 Census, and it seems likely the Republicans will continue to be locked out of both the White House and eventually Congress for the next 8-12 years. In any case, I see Hillary comfortably assured a full eight years as President.\n\nIn what way do you believe my predictions might be off?\n_____\n\n> *Hello, users of CMV!

I don't like either of them, and I don't think I would vote for either of them, but with Cruz out of the race I'm struggling to come up with reasons why trump is automatically the worse candidate. The only thing I can come up with is social policies, but even then Trump just doesn't seem to say much.\n\nI guess the difference is I don't trust Trump because he's an asshole, which is true of most politicians. On the other hand I don't trust Clinton because I feel she's 100% bought and owned by large corporations, so her word means literally nothing and can change based on what the company decides is best. \n\nSo, cmv?\n\n_____\n\n> *Hello, users of CMV!

            "selftext": "I don't like Hillary as a candidate, I want Bernie to win, but voting third party has lost the Democrats elections in the past. If Bernie wins the nomination, I will absolutely vote for him. However, if Hillary gets the nomination, I believe that we should vote for her, because writing in Bernie is going to split the Dem vote, pretty much handing the elections to the Republican candidate.\n\nStrictly speaking on the democratic side, splitting the vote wouldn't be good. The left side of the aisle needs to be able to agree to vote for who gets the nomination, instead of getting so caught up in the \"Bernie or Bust\" stuff. I see a lot of people who say they'd never vote for Hillary, but I believe we should accept the fact that we have a two-party system and, while it would great if we didn't, this election isn't going to dismantle that system. Voting with a write-in is just going to split the Dem vote. \n\nWhen Trump, for instance, said he would run as an Independent if he didn't get the nom, Dems were rooting for that because it would split the Republican vote, basically handing the election. But adamantly pro-Bernie folks don't seem to realize it would work the other way, too. \n\nEdit: Added more to my post to elaborate. \n\n_____\n\n> *Hello, users of CMV!

It was one thing when the GOP race was still in active swing and the press was helping both candidates, but now it's holding the future Democratic nominee back. While the GOP itself may be fractured, the voters have clearly rallied around their candidate. The democrats will lose if they fail to do the same in the near term.\n\nNow, if Bernie really feels \"spreading message\" is important enough to risk a Trump presidency, then at that point he might as well run as an independent and start collecting funds for a general election. The current state of affairs is not helping anyone but Trump.\n___\n\n> *Hello, users of CMV! This is a footnote from your moderators. We'd just like to remind you of a couple of things.

I am from India, and I came to the US a few years ago to do my PhD in a STEM field from a top university. I can't vote here, but consider myself 100% liberal. This automatically rules out any support for Donald Trump from me. \n\nHowever, when I discuss US politics with my American friends here (and I live in a very liberal city/state), they are always saying how much of an asshole he is, mainly citing his xenophobia/racism. \n\nI disagree with this.\n\nIn every clip/interview I have seen of Trump's, he abuses illegal immigrants and rants about them. He has never said he does not want people of other skin colours entering the US. \n\nAs someone who had to struggle a lot to get a US student VISA, I honestly agree with him on his point of punishing illegal immigrants. The first time I applied to universities in the US, I didn't get sufficient funding, and I didn't want to take loans, so I continued working in an awful, mind-numbing job, while strengthening my academic profile, and reapplied a second time - this time getting full funding from my dream university. It was a lot of hard work, doing  good enough research along with a full-time job. I know at least two friends who got admits from top places, got scholarships, but were simply denied student VISAs because their families didn't have sufficient incomes (for those of you unfamiliar with the US VISA process: yes, even if you get scholarships, you need to have proof of funds for one year  in your bank account). \n\nThese are all examples of people from other countries working hard, and more importantly, working honestly, to come to this country. \n\nWhen I know how much I had to work to get here, and how hard my parents worked to give me a good college education in India so that I could some day make it to a top place here, it angers me to see several Mexicans coming into the US illegally, and then when they have children here, they automatically become US citizens. How's that fair? \n\nTherefore, while the great Wall might be completely infeasible and stupid, I think the idea itself is not 'amoral' or 'racist', as many people put it. He might be stupid for suggesting it (because of the cost, etc), but he's not an asshole for doing so. \n\nPlease, CMV. \n_____\n\n> *Hello, users of CMV! This is a footnote from your moderators.

            "selftext": "**NOTE: THE POINT HAS BEEN PARTIALLY CONCEDED. SEE EDIT #3**\n\nDonald Trump's tax plan is estimate to raise the deficit by[ an unprecedented 10 trillion dollars](http://www.politico.com/story/2015/09/donald-trump-tax-plan-analysis-deficit-214211) over the next decade. While this deficit is coming largely from a decrease in taxes, there are no estimates I'm aware of that the resulting growth in GDP would come even close to make up for it.\n\nIn order to pay for this, Trump has only (as far as I know) suggested cutting two federal agencies: The EPA and the DoE. However, the EPA's annual budget is only about $8 billion and about $108 billion on the DoE. Cutting those two departments from the budget totally would only make up for 10% of the revenue loss Trump proposes.\n\nAdditionally, Trump has pledged to spend more on the Military, infrastructure, and a border wall with Mexico estimated to cost billions of dollars, which I don't believe for a second Mexico will pay for. At the end of the day, Trump's federal budget will be a net increase of expenditures with a net decrease of revenue.\n\nSince it is the economically conservative position to *not* have the federal government run on ever-increasing deficits, the fact that Hillary Clinton's plan does not increase the deficit by this much makes her the more economically conservative candidate by default.\n\nEDIT: Since the discussion is turning into a debate over what I mean by \"conservative\" and \"liberal,\" here are my definitions copied from one of my responses:\n\n----\n**Conservatism** is the support of traditional morals and values (in the American context, the support of the Protestant Christian moral and value system), limited federal government power, lower taxes, less government spending, fewer government programs, the preference for private enterprise over public works, and the promotion of the traditional 18th - 20th century American family structure (one man, one woman, and children).\n\n\n**Liberalism** is the support for acceptance of a variety of moral and value systems, increased federal government oversight, a progressive tax tier with very high taxes for higher income brackets, comprehensive government public welfare programs, the preference for public works over private enterprise, and the inclusion of new and non-traditional family structures.\n_____\n\nEDIT #2: A number of posters are missing the nuance of my post. Please keep in mind that I am discussing how each candidate's plans stack up to the conservative ideal ***WHEN IT COMES TO ECONOMIC POLICY AND ONLY ECONOMIC POLICY!***\n\nIn order to change my view, you will have to provide evidence that Trump's economic policies will result in a lower deficit than Clinton's. This is not snark, and I do not believe this is an impossible task. I am definitely willing to consider changing my view if someone provides me with evidence counter to what I have presented.\n\nI will no longer respond to comments that go outside of the economic policy scope. I thought my inclusion of the word \"Economically\" in the title would be sufficient to keep the discussion along those lines, but apparently I was incorrect.\n\n----\n\nEDIT #3: Apparently I am guilty of misreading some of the posts here, and for that I apologize. I concede that Trump is more conservative than Clinton when it comes to economic policy as a whole. When I said economic policy what I meant was the deficit specifically. However, I did not specify this originally, so I have awarded Deltas to those who pointed this out. \n\nI will award additional Deltas to anyone who can convince me Trump won't increase the deficit as much as Clinton will.\n\n> *Hello, users of CMV!

I'm actually a huge Sanders supporter, but I don't think he has a chance.\n\nThat said, it's highly plausible that Clinton will win the Democratic nominee, unless she gets indicted which isn't likely. So we're looking at a Trump vs Clinton in the general. \n\nThere is no way Clinton can win against Trump. Clinton has way too many scandals on her. The worst trump has said were some questionable things about hispanics and Muslims. \n\nAlso, in recent polls [Trump beats Clinton](http://www.wnd.com/2016/05/poll-trump-pops-into-lead-against-hillary/)... it used to be the other way around but as of recent it looks like Trump will beat Clinton.\n\nOn top of that, people are sick and tired of establishment politics.

            "selftext": "Now before I start, I should make clear that I'm 16 and live in Canada, so I will not personally be voting. That said, based on what I know about the US election, I would say Sanders is the best of the major candidates. Sanders seems to me to be the only candidate whose biggest draw is his actual polices rather than superficial characteristics. I'm going to run through the candidates in what I feel is the descending order of how good they are likely to be as president and go through what seem to me to be the main arguments for each one, and why I think Sanders' draws are the most valid.\n\nBernie Sanders' draws:\n* Single-payer healthcare (an issue I think the US has been lagging behind the rest of the developed world on for a long time; it's unlikely it'll happen within his term, but you can't succeed if you don't try)\n* Free public college tuition (My knee-jerk reaction is to say this is impractical, but a number of other countries have already done this, so I'm not willing to rule it out completely. The main concern, it seems, is that some states won't chip in, which is valid, but at the same time it may be better to have it in some states than none.)\n* He's the most anti-war (This is a big one. Clinton is far too hawkish for my tastes. Some have tried to turn this into a negative by acting like he's against all war, which is false-he opposed Iraq and Vietnam, yes, but supported the War in Afghanistan)\n* He's honest and consistent in his values (Superficial characteristics rather than policies, but nevertheless valid, I think. Some claim that this isn't true because he's making promises he knows he can't keep, which is true, but then so did just about every elected official ever, and so are Clinton and Trump-at least he's honest enough [to admit to it](http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/onpolitics/2016/02/29/bernie-sanders-half-loaf-super-tuesday/81116776/))\n* He's not in the pocket of corporations (superficial and less important, but still a point in his favour)\n\nHillary Clinton's draws:\n* She'd be the first female president (and Sanders would be the first Jewish president. So?)\n* She agrees with Sanders on 90% of issues (true, but what makes her better on the remaining 10%?)\n* She's more likely to get her goals accomplished than Sanders (Bullshit! I don't think anyone has EVER been elected to a political office without making promises they knew they wouldn't keep. The difference is that Sanders' policies are radical enough that he could only get half of what he wants accomplished and still have a significant positive effect on the country)\n* She's not as corrupt as people say she is (...OK, but she's still corrupt)\n* She has a lot of experience in politics (Sanders was Mayor of Burlington and has been in Congress for a long time, so this is like saying you should vote for her over Sanders because she's a Democrat)\n* She's more likely to beat Trump than Sanders (In the polls, Sanders beats Trump by more significant margins than Clinton does; anyways, this is a Catch-22-\"people shouldn't vote for Sanders because people won't vote for Sanders\")\n\nDonald Trump:\n* He's honest (bullshit, he's probably the biggest liar of them all)\n* You know what he's going to do (Heh??? His platform changes by the hour!)\n* He's not a pushover (seems to be true, but that doesn't change that his ideas are crap)\n* He's not as much of a lunatic as he portrays himself as (see: Clinton and corruption)\n* He's not controlled by the wealthy (Really? He doesn't control himself?)\n\nNote: I am mainly interested in arguments based on the candidates\u2019 policies, not their personalities.\n\n**EDIT: My view has been changed. Thank you to /u/SomeDefunctEconomist. I'm still not a fan of Clinton or Trump, but I see now that Sanders' policies have a ton of practical issues that I hadn't really thought about.**\n\nEDIT: So, despite the strong arguments of /u/SomeDefunctEconomist and others, this thread has proved my point very well. A lot of people are trying to convince me by attacking Sanders with varying degrees of validity, some are defending the superficial qualities I listed, a few are arguing about whether Sanders has a shot at winning, one or two people are trying to find a clever-sounding way of saying \"Yeah, well that's just, like, your opinion, man\", and everyone is carefully avoiding giving any useful information about Hillary Clinton and/or Donald Trump. Nobody's even attempted to name a single redeeming quality for either.\n\nHillary Clinton supported the PATRIOT ACT, [claimed Hosni Mubarak was a friend of her family](http://blogs.abcnews.com/politicalpunch/2011/01/secretary-clinton-in-2009-i-really-consider-president-and-mrs-mubarak-to-be-friends-of-my-family.html), [couldn't come up with an answer when asked to name something she had accomplished as Secretary of State, has been described by dozens of administration officials, foreign diplomats, friends, and outside analysts as consistently being \"almost always the advocate of the most aggressive actions considered by Mr. Obama\u2019s national security team \u2014 and not just in well-documented cases, like the debate over how many additional American troops to send to Afghanistan or the NATO airstrikes in Libya\"](http://www.nytimes.com/2014/04/17/us/politics/unfinished-business-complicates-clintons-diplomatic-legacy.html?_r=1), [implied that mass incarceration of black youths isn't a real issue](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LqLfvQfuvsA) [and then changed her platform to what BLM protesters were demanding anyway a few days later](http://time.com/time-person-of-the-year-2015-runner-up-black-lives-matter/), [has pushed back against banning fracking in countries around the world and accepted over a million dollars in campaign donations from lobbyists for and executives of oil and gas companies despite pro-environmentalist rhetoric and having attacked Obama for taking a much smaller amount of money from oil companies during the 2008 election](http://www.greenpeace.org/usa/campaign-updates/hillary-clintons-connection-oil-gas-industry/) (to be fair, [Sanders has also accepted (a much smaller amount of) money in campaign donations from oil company executives](http://www.greenpeace.org/usa/these-are-the-facts-on-fossil-fuel-money-going-to-the-clinton-and-sanders-campaigns/)), [oversaw hundreds of billions of dollars worth of arms sales to brutal dictatorships in the Middle East because of the tyrants in power having donated to the Clinton Foundation](http://www.motherjones.com/politics/2015/05/hillary-clinton-foundation-state-arms-deals), [illegally obtained (along with her husband) FBI files on political adversaries](http://www.nytimes.com/1996/06/11/us/whitewater-counsel-examining-use-of-fbi-to-get-gop-files.html), etc., etc., and I haven't even gotten into the main things I've seen her getting attacked for-the e-mail scandal, supporting the war in Iraq, and flip-flopping on gay marriage-yet.\n\nAs for Trump, he supports banning Muslims from immigrating, building a border wall and get Mexico to pay for it (??), beheading the family members of terrorists, and revoking prohibitions on torture as punishment, plus he [used to keep a book of Hitler's speeches by his bedside table (seriously)](http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/donald-trump-used-to-keep-a-book-of-hitlers-speeches-by-his-bed-according-to-his-ex-wife-a6765391.html), [is in nearly a billion dollars of *personal* debt (how is that even possible?)-roughly a quarter of his total net worth-that he just quietly ignores](http://fortune.com/2016/03/23/donald-trump-debt/), denies the existence of global warming for reasons that make it obvious he doesn't even know what the term means (or pretends not to), has changed his mind about what party he belongs to five times since the '90s, supported the wars in Iraq, Afghanistan, and Libya and lied about all three when it became politically convenient, pretended not to know who David Duke was after Duke started supporting his campaign despite having repeatedly and publicly condemned Duke in the past, advocates reversing the progress Obama made regarding healthcare by repealing the ACA, made up a conspiracy theory about Mexico sending rapists into the US for... some reason and claimed to have gotten it from border guards, [attempted to discredit Ted Cruz by making up another conspiracy theory about his father having been involved in the shooting of JFK based on a photo in which the face he claims is Cruz' father isn't even identifiable](http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2016/may/03/donald-trump/donald-trumps-ridiculous-claim-linking-ted-cruzs-f/), [opposes same-sex marriage for reasons that sound like they came straight out of a *Monty Python* skit](http://www.fstdt.com/QuoteComment.aspx?QID=81168), [freely admits to and openly brags about bribing politicians](http://www.cnbc.com/2015/09/17/donald-trump-is-right-paying-politicians-pays.html), etc., etc.\n\nBernie Sanders has some horrible ideas, I admit, particularly in regards to his extreme opposition to free trade and I don't particularly like the idea of his being President. But he also has some ideas which I strongly agree with-single-payer healthcare, avoiding going to war where possible, and ending dependence on fossil fuels among them-so I can at least see a silver lining, and he doesn't seem to be a bad person. I see no big upsides to either Hillary Clinton or Donald Trump getting elected.\n\nThis is not a choice between Bernie Sanders, George Washington, and Abraham Lincoln. It's not even a choice between Bernie Sanders, Benjamin Harrison, and George HW Bush. From what I can see, the choice is whether you prefer your leaders to be inept (Sanders), corrupt (Clinton), or insane (Trump). I maintain Sanders is the least of three evils in this case.\n\nEDIT: Holy fuck, I've forgotten maybe the worst thing about Clinton. [She wants a no-fly zone in Syria](http://www.independent.co.uk/voices/merkel-wants-a-no-fly-zone-in-syria-but-has-she-thought-it-through-a6879901.html). When asked how she would deal with Russian planes continuing to fly over the area, Clinton said she would let them off with a warning the first two times, then failed to answer what she would do the third time. There's really only two ways that policy can go: either the US wastes a fuckton of money on a meaningless gesture that can't be enforced without starting WWIII, or, WWIII. That alone is enough to dispel any notion of Clinton being the \"realistic\", \"pragmatic\", or \"sensible\" candidate, and to dissuade me from supporting her.\n\n_____",

            "selftext": "I completely understand that the state has an interest in having a qualified workforce and that they also have an interest in ensuring that no child is disadvantaged (well, they try), but don't the rights of the parents trump those of the state? Shouldn't the parents be able to decide what is best for their child?\n\nPersonally, I believe that all children should be educated - I think that is *incredibly* important. I think that education should be strongly encouraged and easily accessible. There should be an abundance of information that is given to parents so that they can make an informed decision. There should be a strong societal push toward education and the strong proclamation of its importance.  But I don't believe that force should be used to achieve those ends.\n\nThe main justification for compulsory education is ensuring equal opportunity and making sure that no children are left behind because of the wrongdoing of parents. I completely understand this pov and I agree, but I think that the parent's right to choose ultimately trump the right of the state to use force in this regard. If a child is dying from a treatable illness but a parent refuses to allow treatment, then the state has the right to step in because this is a clear violation of the child's right to life and it trumps the parent's right to choose - there is a clear and present danger. A lack of education, however, does not *inherently* present a lack of opportunity. It may in a lot of cases, but it's not a clear and present danger to the child's future.\n\nThe main justification for freedom of expression is rooted in the belief that if people are presented with two arguments with regard to a particular topic, for and against, then they will be able to choose the correct option. If parents are given the choice between educating their children and not educating their children, shouldn't they be able to make the right decision? If you say no, then how can you believe in universal suffrage? Do you believe that a minority of people don't actually deserve to vote, but we let them anyway, simply hoping that their votes don't have a huge effect? If that's the case, do you believe that, given the right kind of technology, we should exclude certain people from voting?\n\nFrom where I'm standing, the argument for compulsory education seems to stem from a lack of belief in freedom. Again, I think that all children should be educated, and I think that we should encourage parents toward it, but I hate the idea of using force.\n\n_____\n\n> *Hello, users of CMV!

He said the unemployment rate is somewhere between 28-40%, that blacks kill 81% of white homicide victims, which is wildly inaccurate, that John Oliver begged him to be on his show when John Oliver has never talked to him, that he (Trump) was virulently opposed to the Iraq war before the war started, that Ted Cruz's dad associated with Lee Harvey Oswald, along with a million other lies.\n\nNot to mention Trump himself is either lying about his actual positions, or, he is one of the stupidest people to ever become the nominee for a major party.  Possibly the most important issue we face in the near future is global warming.  Trump said that:\n\n\"\"The concept of global warming was created by and for the Chinese in order to make U.S. manufacturing non-competitive.\"\n\nIn my mind that is the single dumbest, most worrying, and all around buffoonish statement I've ever seen of someone running for President.\n\nAnd for those who call Hillary a hawk, Trump wants to send 20-30k troops into Syria to fight ISIS and start capturing and torturing the wives and children of suspected terrorists.  \n\nThe only legitimate reason for a Sanders supporter to vote for Trump is they never really shared Sanders' ideals in the first place\n_____\n\n> *Hello, users of CMV!

Trump has never held public office, so there's no record to look at and see if he takes action against his and his fellow 1% peers.\n\nLooking at his record though, he has a history of lobbying the government for the betterment of himself, his corporation and his fellow 1%s.  A fact that he boasts about when he talks about influencing the Clintons in the past.  Given his record, having the big job on the inside would basically cut the middle-man in his quest to affect change in government in his favor.\n\n2) **He's rich so he doesn't have to listen to his 1% peers.**  Counterargument: You can also say he's rich so he doesn't have to listen to poor people... or constituents or his dog or anyone else.  It's a non-argument to speculate who a person is more or less likely to listen to if they were put in a position of power with no evidence to back up the claims.  Basic human nature has people taking care of their own before others, and in lieu of other evidence, it's wisest to assume that's what he would do.\n\nI'd also challenge the notion that he's so rich he can ignore other big corporations.  His net worth is ~5b the last time I checked but there are trillion dollar corporations out there and many big players that together have a lot of power.  I'd be surprised if he let his brand and businesses be squashed by bigger dogs if push came to shove.  If he was just sacrificing his own wealth that would be one thing, but sacrificing his family and friends is an entirely different matter.\n\nIf someone told me right now, \"hey, you're in a great position to screw over your family\", I would say, \"sure I am, but why would I?\"  I see no evidence to suggest it would be any different for him.\n\n_____\n\n> *Hello, users of CMV!

It's inevitable. If we don't elect a trusted outsider like Bernie, electing the volatile Trump will incite the overdue overthrow of our inept government.",

He made some comments about Mexico that some people construe as being racist, but in context I think he was talking more about illegal immigrants than Mexicans in general.  Transcript below was taken from [Washington post ](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/post-politics/wp/2015/06/16/full-text-donald-trump-announces-a-presidential-bid/).  \n\nHis other famous statement is about banning Muslims from entering the US.  Again, I don't think this is about race or religion itself.  I believe this is targeted at *immigrants* and *tourists* of the Islamic religion seeking travel in the US, not US citizens, legal residents, or Visa holders.  \n\n>When do we beat Mexico at the border? They're laughing at us, at our stupidity. And now they are beating us economically. They are not our friend, believe me. But they're killing us economically.\n\n>The U.S. has become a dumping ground for everybody else's problems.\n\n>(APPLAUSE)\n\n>Thank you. It's true, and these are the best and the finest. When Mexico sends its people, they're not sending their best. They're not sending you. They're not sending you. They're sending people that have lots of problems, and they're bringing those problems with us. They're bringing drugs. They're bringing crime. They're rapists. And some, I assume, are good people.\n\n>But I speak to border guards and they tell us what we're getting. And it only makes common sense. It only makes common sense. They're sending us not the right people.\n\n>It's coming from more than Mexico. It's coming from all over South and Latin America, and it's coming probably -- probably -- from the Middle East. But we don't know. Because we have no protection and we have no competence, we don't know what's happening. And it's got to stop and it's got to stop fast.\n_____\n\n> *Hello, users of CMV!

            "selftext": "First off im from europe and dont really give a rats arse about american politics, so all the knowledge i have about trump is from videos and dank memes of him saying ridiculously stupid stuff (i.e the wall, small loan of a million dollars, etc.) which led me to believe that Donald Trump is just a joke, almost like you guys are letting the retarded kid have a go. So i never gave it much thought.\n\nThat being said, lately ive seen that he actually has alot, and i mean **a-fucking-LOT** of support.\n\nHow could it be? How could this seemingly racist caricature of a president actually get elected? Is this some massive in-joke i've been left out on? Is it actually me who is retarded? It's almost like the first time you take LSD. You start to question... well, everything.\n\nSo i started questioning my (admittedly very uninformed) view, so much so that i actually read /r/The_Donald posts from time to time.\n\nAnd this is the scary part, more often than not i actually agree with what this seemingly twisted fascist has to say, i cant really name anything specific because i forget about it shortly after reading it. (Like i said, i just dont really care, it doesnt affect me enough.)\n\nNow comes the part where you have to convince me, or if im perfectly honest, do the research for me. Because i dont care enough to put any actual effort into it, to read trough walls of articles which only contain two sentences of information i actually need.\n\nWait, isn't that kind of the point of this sub when you get down to it?\n\nTL:DR\nI want to see the good side of Trump.\n\nExcuse the grammar, im drunk and on small amount of shrooms. (Which is not an excuse, i know, but at least some context.)\n\nEDIT: If you're in the same position as me [/u/Murlocgoesmurgle's post is phenomenal.](https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/4ixrdh/cmv_donald_trump_is_a_joke/d321kah)\n\nEDIT 2: This is thread is fucking amazing. All of you are making incredible points, regardless whether they're pro or contra. I didn't expect this thread to be as unbiased as it is.\n\nEDIT 3: Well done reddit. While you haven't made me a Trump \"fan\", however reading all of your replies and discussions made me realize how Trump would be ultimately the \"lesser evil\" and made me understand why so many people support him.\n\nA couple of hours ago i would have never imagined ever stating this, but if i was american, i would probably support Trump.\n\n_____\n\n> *Hello, users of CMV!

            "selftext": "With the election shaping up to look like a match-up between Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump, there has been much talk about what to do about so-called \"Rational Republicans.\" I am referring to Republicans who are ideologically aligned with people like Jeb Bush, Marco Rubio, John Kasich, Paul Ryan etc. and likely supported one of the first three names listed in the Republican primary. Many of these Republicans have been openly \"Never Trump\" and have spoken repeatedly about the harm that a Trump presidency could have on the United States and the Republican party. It is rare for such a large block of Republicans to be so opposed to their presumptive nominee and it presents a tempting opportunity for Clinton supporters to recruit these \"Rational Republicans\" to the Clinton cause to help Clinton win in an electoral landslide. I personally believe this is a very bad idea.\n\nFirst, Clinton is already a clear favorite over Donald Trump in a general. Virtually every national poll has shown Clinton with a sizable lead. Trump and Clinton are extremely well known and most people have a firmly established opinion of both candidates. That makes it so that polls even this far out, are less likely to change. Demographics that hate Trump (minorities, women etc.) aren't likely to change as it takes something extraordinary to change a long term and firmly held belief.\n\nSecond, demographics were already on the Democrats' side. Even before Trump was the nominee, Republicans knew the 2016 presidential election was going to be an uphill climb. In the post-2012 election defeat autopsy, Republican leaders acknowledged that the electoral math simply does not add up unless the Republicans do better with Latino voters. With Trump alienating Latinos at a greater rate than previous Republican candidates, it is unlikely that we will see a reversal of the trends in electoral voting that have emerged in recent elections. Trumps claims that he will re-set the electoral map are dubious at best and not supported by his extremely high unfavorable ratings with core constituencies that would be required for such a massive shift.\n\nThird, courting Republicans will alienate devoted progressives and it will be a net loss in Democratic voter totals. Many left-wing Sanders supporters have derided Clinton for not being a true progressive. Moving further to the right to court \"Rational Republicans\" will only further infuriate progressive Sanders supporters making them more likely to vote third party if they choose to vote at all. \"Rational Republicans\" also speak openly about their hatred for Clinton, and while their hatred for Trump might outweigh their hatred for Clinton, it is likely that many \"Rational Republicans\" will choose not to vote for either candidate.\n\nFourth, and most importantly, this election presents a massive opportunity for Democrats to seize control of the House and Senate. The single greatest driver of voter turnout is a Presidential election. House and Senate elections see significantly lower turnouts during mid-term elections than in years with a presidential election. Many voters tend to vote purely along party lines, and as such, voters who vote for a president from a particular party are much more likely to also vote for Congressional candidates of the same party. \"Rational Republicans\" would likely be the exception to this idea. Their vote for Hillary would likely not be an indicator of increased support for Democratic candidates for the House and Senate. Increased turnout among \"Rational Republicans\" would likely be a good sign for Republican candidates for Congress. On the other hand, increased turnout from progressive Sanders supporters would likely boost the chances of Democratic congressional candidates. The best thing that can happen for Democrats in down ticket races is for \"Rational Republicans\" to be demoralized seeing no suitable candidate for President to motivate them to get out to the polls and for progressives to come out in force.\n\nP.S. If any Bernie supporters are going to argue that Bernie will get the nomination, my argument is based in the extremely likely world in which Hillary wins the nomination. Whether Bernie can/will win the nomination is a separate argument from this post.\n_____\n\n> *Hello, users of CMV! This is a footnote from your moderators.

            "selftext": "I don't agree with most of what Trump says, but this one makes sense to me. I have a premonition that this will be a long post, so I'll label these to make it easier to refer to specific components.\n\nAlso: I'm far from an expert on this subject. I know enough of microeconomics to know what \"Dead weight loss\" is, but that's about it.\n\n**1: Assumptions:** At the moment, I believe that America has:\n\n* *A* An abundance of natural resources\n\n* *B* Relatively good infastructure\n\n* *C* A substantial skilled workforce\n\n* *D* Concerns about unemployment\n\n* *E* Positive Immigration Pressure (or whatever you call it when people are trying to get in)\n\n* *F* Concerns about tax rate & federal budget\n\n* *G* A trade deficit\n\n* *H* A wealthy, voracious consumer market\n\n**2: General Reasoning** To me, this seems pretty simple: \n\n* *A* The American government gets revenue from the things we continue to import. (Some of this increased tax will fall on the American consumer, but some will fall on the foreign producer, so it's a net win for us)\n\n* *B* The American government gets tax revenue from whatever production (and associated profits) shift to this country\n\n* *C* Americans get hired for the manufacturing jobs, decreasing unemployment & increasing American wealth.\n\n* *D* Dis-entanglement of American foreign policy from the economy: If we produce more locally, we become more self-reliant, and we have greater freedom to act out of either concern for our own security or for human rights abroad.\n\n\n**Rebuttals to common arguments**\n\n**3: Ineffeciency**\n\nOne of the arguments for free trade is that each product can be made by those most equipped to do so effeciently, so net utility increases. Except:\n\n* *A* I think that in almost every case, America is very well-equipped for effecient production due to **1A-1E**above. (We've got the resources, we've got the roads and electricity, we've got the workforce, and if we don't have the workforce we can relax immigration standards until we do again.) It seems like the reasons stuff gets made abroad is down to two things: American taxes may be higher, and American workers cost more. Those are perfectly good reasons for a company to move its production abroad while keeping its sales in America, but it doesn't decrease net utlity to make things in the US - the taxes and wages aren't lost, just restributed to workers and the government.\n\n* *B* The wage-and-tax issue actually leads to greater TOTAL ineffeciency, because some actual waste (for instance, transport costs, producing in countries that have worse infastructure) leads to resources being spent that don't profit anyone.\n\n**4: Increased cost to Consumers**\n\nI understand the reasoning here, but it seems like both cost *and* wealth would go up - more jobs and lower federal taxes (due to more local income and tariff revenue offsetting federal spending) would give American consumers more to spend. The difference in cost would come down to, again, increased wages & taxes - and we wouldn't be losing money to transportation costs, foreign wages and foreign taxes.\n\n**5: If we stop free trade, so does everyone else in retaliation**\n\n* *A* Not everyone has free trade now. We're paying tariffs to some of the countries we export to, so at worst this would be the difference between \"Losing sometimes\" to \"Equal fotting all the time\"\n\n* *B* We have a trade deficit, so assuming everyone tariffs evenly, we should still be getting the better deal. \n\n* *C* A lot of countries don't have the production advantages America enjoys. So, they would be in a weaker position for tariffs - we could set ours higher (and produce what we need at home), but they would be more necessarily reliant on imports.",

            "selftext": "1) Income: Trump has made the size of his fortune a centerpiece of his presidential campaign, implying that it\u2019s a measure of his success as a businessman. He has also correctly noted that the income shown on his tax returns isn\u2019t a reflection of his total wealth. Even so, income is a basis for assessing some of the foundations of any individual\u2019s wealth -- and would certainly reflect the financial wherewithal of the businesses in which Trump is involved.\n\nAfter Fortune\u2019s Shawn Tully dug into Trump\u2019s financial disclosures with the Federal Election Commission and an accompanying personal balance sheet his campaign released, he noted in March that Trump \u201cappears to have overstated his income, by a lot, which could be the reason he has so far tried to avoid releasing his returns.\u201d Tully said that Trump apparently boosted his income in the documents by conflating his various businesses\u2019 revenue with his personal income. Trump didn\u2019t respond to Tully\u2019s assessment, but he could clear up all of that by releasing his tax returns. \n\n2) Business Activities: Trump has long claimed that his company, the Trump Organization, employs thousands of people. He has also criticized Fortune 500 companies for operating businesses overseas at the expense of jobs for U.S. workers. Trump\u2019s returns would show how active he and his businesses are globally -- and would help substantiate the actual size and scope of his operation.\n\n3) Charitable Giving: Trump has said that he\u2019s a generous benefactor to a variety of causes -- especially war veterans -- even though it\u2019s been hard to find concrete evidence to support the assertion. Other examples of major philanthropic largess from Trump have also been elusive. Trump could release his tax returns and put the matter to rest.\n\n4) Tax Planning: There\u2019s been global attention focused on the issue of how politicians and the wealthy use tax havens and shell companies to possibly hide parts of their fortunes from authorities. If released, Trump\u2019s returns would make clear whether or not he used such vehicles.\n\n5) Transparency and Accountability: Trump is seeking the most powerful office in the world. Some of the potential conflicts of interest or financial pressures that may arise if he reaches the White House would get an early airing in a release of his tax returns.\n\nFor the last 40 years, presidential candidates have released their returns. Trump, of course, has portrayed himself as the un-candidate, the guy who bucks convention. But disclosing tax returns is a valuable political tradition that\u2019s well worth preserving.\n\nTotally agree with the above stated points, all taken from [this article](https://www.bloomberg.com/view/articles/2016-05-12/time-for-donald-trump-to-release-his-tax-returns)\n\n\nEDIT: Was not originally 500 characters.\n_____\n\n> *Hello, users of CMV!

            "selftext": "How are people defending Cap for supporting Bucky? Brainwashing or not, Bucky is a domestic terrorist and should be treated as such. Removing the politics (where I agree with Tony Stark and the Sokovia Records), friendship doesn't trump a guy whose actions in two movies have essentially caused three 9/11's. Cap also lied to Tony about how his father died just so Tony would try to go easier on the both of them when shit hits the fan. You can argue the Avengers do the right thing even when the governments don't agree; you can't agree that a brainwashed psychopathic mass-murderer isn't a villain. How he's treated as a regular dude by Steve, Sam and is basically not even questioned by Ant-Man and Black Widow is beyond me.\n\nThis is in stark contrast to Captain America's moral fiber as well: Captain America is a war-hound. He always tries to \"punch his way out\" of situations and at best shows mild sympathy to the Wakandians who were casualties of their fight with Crossbones. Why would he still love Bucky when he is a.) a criminal and b.) a former shell of himself? At best, he should have agreed to be an informant for the government, explained his situation and helped the proper authorities find and identify Zemo.\n\n_____\n\n> *Hello, users of CMV!

            "selftext": "**Edit 2**: *After my first edit, people are simply doubling down on the argument I have found to be unpersuasive, as described in the first edit. I see a Trump presidency as potentially catastrophic. Given his brash, bullying temperament, I see him as possibly going as far as to ignore the Constitution and arrest Congress if it doesn't pass the legislation he wants. He may get us into nuclear war over a personal insult from a world leader. Barring the most catastrophic scenarios, I see him as likely to do damage to the United States' world standing, harm the economy with poorly thought policy, and just keep the nation in gridlock because Congress is unlikely to work with him. Democracy will have failed because essentially the people will have chosen suicide because of a dislike for Mexicans. To successfully change my view, it would be better to argue how Trump could be a good President or at least not a catastrophic one.*\n\n**Edit**: *Most have made an argument that, on the contrary, if Donald Trump is elected, that's a success of democracy because the outcome will have been the will of the people. This argument will not change my view. By failure, I am referring to our process producing a decided terrible outcome, indicating that perhaps the system needs to be abandoned or greatly overhauled to prevent similar outcomes in the future.*\n\nFirst off, this is not about potential sour grapes. I disagreed with George W. Bush on policy, especially foreign policy, when he was President, but I nevertheless respected the office, and aside from the controversy around *Bush v. Gore* and the Florida recounts, I believe our Constitutional system mostly functioned. What I mean is that Donald Trump is a contemptible human being and utterly unfit to hold our the United States' highest public office before we even consider whatever policy positions his campaign may have mustered.\n\nDonald Trump is utterly incapable of leadership because to lead one must command respect, and Trump can garner only disdain except from a base that's ignorant and often bigoted. Trump's interpersonal style is unsuited to diplomacy and maintaining good relations with our allies. His vitriol is divisive and inspires hatred in many. He is crass, bullying, and clownish. He has spoken ill of Hispanics, women, and others he would have to represent as President, and I believe few would be willing to overlook it.\n\nWhat is the alternative? I do not know, but if Trump becomes President, it will become clear American democracy has run its course and failed.\n\n_____\n\n> *Hello, users of CMV! This is a footnote from your moderators.

            "selftext": "When Trump announced he would be running for president many of us rolled our eyes. Yet, here he is as the leading Republican candidate in our upcoming election. How did he possibly get this far? There are several reasons that explain this, such as wide media coverage and loss of faith in political system. However, I'd like to focus on one particular phenomenon that I believe is directly responsible for the support of Donald Trump: the minority uproar.\n\nAmerica has been experiencing a minority uproar. The Black Lives Movement is one of the hottest topics in America right now. It is quite possibly one of the most combustible and diving issues of the 2010's. We have had a black president for the past 8 years and African American's have been putting a lot of pressure on society to be held accountable for poor treatment of minority groups, with a tremendous focus on police. I believe that the group-position thesis is a good way to support this theory.\n\nThe group-position thesis views racial animus not merely as a consequence of negative feelings between members of different racial groups but, more centrally, as a reflection of group competition and conflict over material rewards, power, and status in a multiracial society. This establishes an immediate clash between whites and non-whites, with a major focus on African Americans. These competing interests polarize racial beliefs and rationalize differing perceptions of social institutions, such as law enforcement.\n\nA General Social Survey revealed that 48 percent of whites believe blacks are \u201cviolence-prone.\u201d This unsettling percentage reflects the group-position model as it exhibits that many whites are acclimated to hold racial bias in regard to criminality and to favor aggressive law enforcement. Furthermore, whites are often more skeptical of criticism of the police due to the fact that they commonly identify with the police. The group-position model essentially legitimizes whites positive attitudes about police because to accept that minorities are mistreated would lend credence to reforms that might dilute crime control, thereby putting whites in danger.\n\nOn the flip side, the group-position theory anticipates that minorities should be more inclined to view the police as tangible evidence of minority domination. Police misconduct serves as a basis for minorities to cite examples of police corruption. This is true granted the focal point of the BLM campaign has been capturing examples of police misconduct on camera and exposing it online.\n\nHow does this relate to the Trump election? [The majority of white's are Republican while the majority of minorities are Democratic.](http://www.people-press.org/2015/04/07/party-identification-trends-1992-2014/) White's tend to fall into the conservative category and Trump is indeed conservative. His slogan is \"Make America Great Again!\" To me this means \"Take Power Back From Minorities!\" Now, I would argue that minorities never truly gained power, but they did get a lot of attention and momentum on this issue. Trump has already expressed border-line xenophobic and racist views. He is anti-refugee and pro-wall. He has even praised police on many occasions. Therefore, white people who are against BLM and the minority agenda are very likely to support Trump.\n\nIf you disagree with me please tell me why!\n\n**Note: None of my statements are exhaustive. I used terms like \"in general\" and \"the majority\" intentionally. I know that not all whites are inclined to have racist beliefs nor are they all conservative. Also, I know that the BLM campaign is not solely backed by minorities. For the record, I'm white.**\n_____\n\n> *Hello, users of CMV! This is a footnote from your moderators.

            "selftext": "Returns to [capital have historically outpaced income growth in the last 40 years](http://gabriel-zucman.eu/files/SaezZucman2014Slides.pdf). Put differently: returns from investment income (ownership of stocks, real estate, IP etc) has been exponentially greater than money earned from human capital through salaries or other forms of compensation. [This has been one of the primary factors leading to expanding inequality](http://www.nber.org/digest/dec08/w13982.html), and why one hears about how the 1% (or even more accurately, the .01%). 50 years ago, differences in income inequality might have been a function of one's boss making a great deal more money than their average employee (the CEO of GM vs a line worker), but the reality today is that a few select firms (the Goldman Sachs or the Googles of the world) [produce far more wealth than most of the rest of the entire middle of the economy combined](http://cep.lse.ac.uk/pubs/download/dp1354.pdf).\n\nConsequently, if one has an investment stake in those firms (or in areas of the economy closely associated with those firms) -- like say NYC real estate -- then returns to those investments will be far greater than even a larger investment in another sector of the economy. [This trend has been termed \"financialization\"](http://www.hup.harvard.edu/catalog.php?isbn=9780674050846) and the overwhelming empirical evidence is that these changes have [led investments away from the \"real economy\"](http://courses.umass.edu/econ711-rpollin/Krippner---Financialization%202005.pdf) (in terms of making goods and services consumed by average consumers) because again, capital returns from a few select firms is an overwhelmingly smarter investment because those returns have outpaced basically everything else.\n\n[There are thus widespread popular misunderstandings of inequality](http://ftp.iza.org/dp9100.pdf), which is actually almost entirely a function of returns from this particular type of capital ownership (education and technology certainly shapes *who* are members of the middle-class -- a question of mobility -- but differences between various classes expanding a great deal is key). \n\nThere are two primary reasons for these trends: [congenial macroeconomic conditions](http://www.nber.org/chapters/c11075.pdf) in terms of both monetary policy (the Fed emphasizing price stability instead of full employment) and [fiscal policy](http://gabriel-zucman.eu/files/Zucman2015SlidesShort.pdf) (reduced welfare spending and historically low tax rates and even granted those tax rates, globalization allows for free capital mobility and the ability to hide in places like Switzerland, Panama, and Ireland.) [The shrinking role of labor unions in setting norms of compensation (and their associated political activity) is probably one of the major reasons for this difference in economic institutions.](\nhttp://www.asanet.org/images/journals/docs/pdf/asr/WesternandRosenfeld.pdf)\n\n>  The end result of this is that [middle-class and working-class people have essentially had zero income growth since 1979](http://www.nber.org/papers/w22211) while those with even a slight ability to make capital investments since the early 1980s have seen fantastic returns. Pdf [here](http://content.csbs.utah.edu/~mli/Economics%207004/CBO%20income%20growth.pdf). \n\n\nThus, [as a few journalists have pointed](http://www.vox.com/2015/9/2/9248963/donald-trump-index-fund) out, [Trump would be about as wealthy today if he simply did absolutely nothing](http://www.lrb.co.uk/v37/n20/deborah-friedell/tycooniest) based on his own self-declared net-worth in assets he owned in 1982 because this is what empirically economic sociologists and economists show are the trends in returns to capital ownership -- he could have invested all of his money in an index fund. Trump (and his peers) have benefited from a political economy that has created conditions for fantastic returns.\n\nGiven these facts, on what basis can we conclude that Trump is the great businessman that he claims to be?\n",

I've read a lot about Hilary, but I realized today that almost everything I know about Trump has been through the lens of the popular media. And I've seen what they've done to Bernie. It made me realize that I ought to try to get a truer understanding of Trump before I completely decide against him.\n\nI know he's brutally direct in how he talks, and that's fine because I care more about truth than offense. So show me more than the news has. Why are so many people behind him? If he's allegedly such a racist and sexist, then why is he polling so well with women, blacks and Latinos compared to other Republican candidates? Sell me on him.\n\n1. Don't just make this about Hilary. I don't want to hear why she's bad; I want to hear why Donald is better.\n\n2. Specifics, please. Every candidate says they'll make everything wonderful. I am mostly concerned with the **how**. What are his positions and solutions on economics, foreign policy, education, etc.?\n\n\n\n_____\n\n> *Hello, users of CMV!

I was wrong, there were worse potential candidates that not only existed but were running with the chance for nomination.\n\nNow that it's looking like it's going to be Trump vs Clinton, and the corruption, behaviour, deceit and anti-democratic tactics from the  Clinton political machine are looking more insidious and devious and potentially destructive than Trumps name calling, narcissism and authoritarian views. I'm starting to think that Trump might be the better option.\n\nFurther, Trump is nowhere near as bought as Clinton, she appears to be in the pocket of the kind of people who have destroyed you middle class, and removed human rights while expanding inequality to some serious extremes.\n\nWith Trump, there's really no knowing what he's going to do (if you do know, please share it), because he seems to pander to both sides the same as Hillary, but some of the stuff he says is pretty out there, and some of it is actually kind of sensible. But at least with him, you know it's less likely to be for the kind of people who control CNN, MSNBC, the drug companies, the banks; unless he starts taking bribes of course. \n\nPlus if he does push through some serious right wing, neo liberal, free market policies, it will shift the next economic crash forward, so that it brings on the next \"new deal\" or something similar a lot faster. I think he is the candidate that is most likely to bring about change.\n\nIn the meantime, please do your best to get Sanders over the line.

            "selftext": "I'm 53 and I've changed my political affiliation a few times in my life. I find that I'm basically moderate with a pro-science leaning. \n\nI've voted all over the spectrum, but I always vote for the person not the party. Full disclose, I did not vote for Obama both times. However, Obama is our president and I have directly benefited from several of his legislative victories and I personally know many others who have received medical treatment and stayed on their parents' health insurance at a critical time in their lives) who previously would have been kicked off. \n\nI'm no Obama freak. He makes me angry pretty much on a weekly basis, but he's our fairly and legally ellected president... and is just a human being. George W Bush was also someone whom I both supported and questioned. I skeptically considered things Bush did and tried to do. My disagreements with his and Obama's sensabilities was always based on the argument at hand, not their party or their religion or wealth. I did not allow these individual questions paint their entire presidency with one broad thoughtless stroke. Complaining as a sport is destructive and so fucking wrong. \n\nWe are looking at what may become one of the most contentious and insane election cycles in US history. I'm no fan of either Trump or Clunton and truthfully I don't know who I'll vote for, but whoever wins, I know they are going to try to do the best they can. Mistakes will be made and candles will happen, but I can assure you, it helps no one to blindly state that everything that president does is based in ruining the country or shipping your job overseas. Be reasonable and research the issue before painting the president as an out-of-touch fool. \n_____\n\n> *Hello, users of CMV! This is a footnote from your moderators.

            "selftext": "We as Americans pride ourselves on leading the world in basically everything, but we've been steadily slipping backwards. The rise of America in the brief history we've had has shown that all of us working together for the benefit of all can make us great and powerful as a nation.  We, as a people, seek to improve the lives of everyone, everywhere, and empower the powerless, to reward the innovators, to embolden the meek, to strengthen the weak, protect the helpless, and provide an equal opportunity for all, no matter where they come from, what they believe, or what color their skin.  As American citizens, we wish that every person on this planet could live in freedom and have a voice in how their country is governed, so they too can live healthy, happy and prosperous lives.  Immigrants literally built this country from the ground up, and the diversity of our peoples has given us a fondness for a wide range of music, foods, arts, and culture that simply doesn't exist in many parts of the world.\n\n'Together we stand, divided we fall' is not just a clever phrase, it is the very foundation of what has built us into a mighty nation, but that idea has decayed over time.  It has decayed to the point now where one of the most popular candidates in recent history is standing before the American people, ranting and raving about building walls to keep people out (which could also keep us in), denigrating our neighboring countries, calling their people rapists, thieves and drug dealers.  Donald Trump stands for everything that is *wrong* with America today.  He's extremely wealthy, arrogant, has no experience, and is abrasive.  If we truly want to make America great again, electing someone like him would not only continue the downward trend, but accelerate it.  We are trying to narrow the wage gap, so electing a billionaire certainly won't help with that (it's in his own self-interest to get richer, not poorer).  We want to improve our relations with the world, and he's doing a fine job of pissing people off without even being in office.  We want someone who can compromise and work with people, and yet he's proven that everything is his way or it's no way.  He's more inclined to act like a tyrant than a crusader for the common man.\n\nIn short, Donald Trump stands for what makes America SUCK, and we need someone who represents our desire to be a shining example.  We want a leader who inspires people to be better, not someone who incites racism, intolerance and ignorance.\n\n_____\n\n> *Hello, users of CMV! This is a footnote from your moderators.

            "selftext": "EDIT:\n\nImagine a world in which your political views resembles the Pokemon ditto. No parents, no upbringing, no class, money, or any of that shit. You ARE a clean slate.\n\nImagine you get a perfect, politically neutral education and are asked to cast vote on a candidate based on your judgement of his/her merits.\n\nDoesn't that sound nice? **That's my fucking point. And the downvoters seem to think that \"since he posted this CMV he must think he is immune to bias, the perfect independent\". Like honestly just read the post.... It is a discussion, and by downvoting the post all you demonstrate is that you think you're views are better than mine, and are afraid to try and hash that out. Screw off the sub because you ruin it.**\n\n\n\n________________________________________________________\n\nThis view is simple. Independent is the sole reasonable, political self-label because:\n\n- Certain Ideas/views from both (and other) sides are valuable to the process and country. \n\n- Independent people, not in a political sense, by definition make their own decisions based on their 'unfettered' ability to reason. \n\n- Self labeling as strictly one 'political side' both makes you susceptible to same-side trickery, and blind to the opposing side's potential merit. \n\n- The parties negatively feed on wholehearted, unreasonable supporters who refuse to see to good ideas from another side. \n\n- Both parties (and others), as they stand, move politics forward, and good policy relies on give and take from members on each side, rendering independent, or 'in the middle' the most efficient label for an individual following politics. This being said, I recognize the, at times personal, gain that comes from 'leaning one way or the other', even if only slightly, however this is by nature non-conducive to the political process. \n\nI understand that there exist benefits and purpose to registering as a certain party in certain states, this view does not concern that. \n\nThank you so much for reading. CMV \n\n________________________________________________________\n\nI understand your analogy but it does not apply. You did not choose your biological sex, and therefore, like most people, you would enjoy the lack of cognitive/societal dissonance that comes with *feeling/identifying as a gender that aligns with your biological sex.*\n\n>someone who calls him/herself an independent is not any more \"unfettered\" in their capacity for objective reasoning\n\nThis is true, however it does not invalidate the generalizations made in my text.\n\n**The issue here is that strong political polarization among individuals seems to limit 'unfettered' ability to reason and/or perceptual abilities.**\n\n________________________________________________________\n\n>If I already hate the GOP platform\n\nThis literally proves my point...\n\nIt lets you ignore the GOP's message because it doesn't fit your ideas perfectly. That is worsening the stagnation.\n\n**If your personal beliefs are I already hate (position) and will base my present opinion on (issue) because of my opinion of (position), then you are being unreasonable.**\n\n**I think pro-lifers are fucking retards, but I arrived at this through my understanding of the prevalence of rape. Not my hate for religion.**\n\n________________________________________________________\n\n>But...you are (or at least were) literally a Democrat. You are/were a registered member of the Democratic party. What does it mean to you to be a Democrat, if not this?\n\nI voted for Bernie, does that inherently 'make me a democrat', or does it inherently mean 'I agree with him most'? I do not self-label as a democrat, even if I registered democrat. I only did the latter to cast my desired vote in the primary. It does not make sense to me to BE a democrat (whatever this means to you), **because Bernie is just as radical as Trump.** I just think he deserves the job.\n\n>I don't see how \"leaning strongly to one side\" is a necessary result of being a Democrat or Republican.\n\nI am totally lost. Of course it is not a necessary result. Leaning strongly to one side all of the time (i.e. 'being a (party)') regardless of the lack of merit in that position, **is unreasonable and serves to stagnate politics.**\n\n________________________________________________________\n\n**if you have been conditioned to be a strong democrat, your ability to reason and judge the merits of republican ideas is fettered, even if only slightly. This serves to stagnate politics, in that you would rather look at how you personally disagree with someone, than at the issues at hand and the merits of the proposed solutions from whatever side.**\n\nThank you for your meaningless down votes. View remains that independents/moderates (as true independents don't exist) are far more reasonable than 'strong (party)s'. 1 delta awarded for what is in parenthesis.

            "selftext": "I understand that a president does not have control over creating new laws, so some of his more outlandish ideas will get nowhere. These include: building the wall, the temporary ban on Muslims, and imposing heavy trade tariffs that would lead to a trade war. However, the President still has an impact when it comes to nominating Supreme Court Justices, foreign policy, and having the \u2018bully pulpit\u2019 to speak to the American people and the world. This is a bit of a rant and some of it is just speculation, so bear with me. \n\n\nFirst, let\u2019s talk about the Supreme Court. Trump has released a list of possible picks and they seem to have views similar to the late Antonin Scalia. The prospect of Trump nominating two or more conservative justices would likely have a huge negative impact on social freedoms.  A woman\u2019s right to choose would be possibly taken away. Many states are passing more and more restrictive laws on abortion, and Oklahoma even considered a law to ban it completely. It would only be a matter of time before a law to completely ban abortion is passed in one of the states, in which case it would be appealed to a Federal court and possibly all the way up to the Supreme Court. A conservative court would be more likely to approve of the ban, paving the way for more states to do the same. These restrictive laws would also force even more reproductive health clinics across the country to close, as happened in Texas. In the wake of the clinic closures, teen pregnancy rates have gone up due to the lack of easily available reproductive healthcare. It\u2019s likely that this trend would spread to the rest of the country if more restrictive abortion laws are passed. \n\nMore and more \u2018religious liberty\u2019 laws would be upheld, paving the way towards discrimination against certain groups in the name of religion. \n\nConsidering how the conservative side of the court also ruled in favor of Citizens United vs FEC, we could also possibly see more deregulation of election law and more corporate money making its way into politics to influence elections. \n\nPerhaps the President\u2019s biggest power is the area of foreign policy. I don\u2019t think we fully understand what a Trump foreign policy looks like, but some of the things he has said give us some clues. \n\nTrump has openly stated that he is ok with the idea of committing war crimes by targeting the families of known terrorists. If the military complies with his orders, the Muslim world would likely turn more towards extremism and our allies in the region would rethink their commitments to allowing American troops in the region. Osama bin Laden created Al-Qaeda simply because American troops were stationed in his home of Saudi Arabia during the gulf war. How many more Osama bin Ladens will we create by killing innocent civilians? This would possibly lead to  an even more destabilized middle east, and the supply of oil could be affected drastically. With oil markets in turmoil, we could see even higher oil prices than 2007-2008 and another great recession or even a global depression. Even if the military does not comply with his orders, terrorists groups in the region would have a field day with propaganda as they try to frame the west as the enemy of Islam. This is not even the worst case scenario. More and more information has been coming to light about Saudi Arabia\u2019s possible role in 9/11. I could see Trump taking this information, blowing it out of proportion to use against Hillary in the upcoming election, and enraging the American public to the point where we are dragged into a trade war or full blown war against Saudi Arabia. If that happens, Pax Americana as we know it is over. You think terrorism is bad now? Wait until we start waging war against the Muslim holy land. It will no longer be a war against rogue terrorists groups. It will be a war between America and the entire Muslim world.\n\nTrump has also stated that he wants our allies to compensate us for military assistance, and lessen our role in NATO. Since World War II, America has prevented the likelihood of another major conventional war breaking out because of our system of complex alliances around the world. If Trump decides to break these commitments, I think we could see regional powers like China and Russia becoming more aggressive. What\u2019s especially worrying is the prospect of a more aggressive, nationalistic China. East and south east Asia is probably the largest global marketplace. A showdown with China in the region could restrict trade in the region and lead to a market collapse. \n\n\nPerhaps one of the most underestimated abilities of the President is the ability to easily communicate his or her ideas to the rest of the world. Trump has captured the attention of the world as a Presidential candidate with his outlandish, dangerous ideas. As President, his ability to communicate would be much greater. Trumps inflammatory rhetoric could do irreversible damage to our image abroad. I can\u2019t think of another leader in modern American history that has had such inflammatory rhetoric. Back in January, the UK parliament debated about whether they should ban Trump from the UK. Mexican communities have been selling Trump pi\u00f1atas, while the former President of Mexico stated \u2018I\u2019m not going to pay for that fucking wall.\u2019 I\u2019m sure the Muslim world has no love for Trump either. What would the rest of the world think of us if we elected this man to be our President? Many don\u2019t care about what the rest of the world views us, but the damage to our image abroad could have some really nasty impacts. I think you may see American companies boycotted in several markets, and leaders across the world would think twice about cooperating with such a divisive figure. \n\nWhen you consider all of these things together, I think it would mean the beginning of the end of Pax Americana and the era of America as the sole superpower. It won\u2019t be the final nail in the coffin, but it will accelerate our decline on the world stage. \n\n",

            "selftext": "Donald Trump has repeatedly called the science behind climate change into question, denouncing it as a hoax that will make American businesses less competitive. He has also vowed to renegotiate international agreements meant to curb the output of greenhouse gases.\n\nAs a private business owner, Donald Trump's company recently filed papers seeking permission to build a wall to protect one of his golf courses on the coast of Ireland from coastal erosion caused by rising sea-levels. According to Politico \"The statement acknowledges one Irish government study that assumes a steady rate of erosion through 2050, but argues that the study fails to account for the effects of climate change: 'If the predictions of an increase in sea level rise as a result of global warming prove correct, however, it is likely that there will be a corresponding increase in coastal erosion rates not just in Doughmore Bay but around much of the coastline of Ireland. In our view, it could reasonably be expected that the rate of sea level rise might become twice of that presently occurring. \u2026 As a result, we would expect the rate of dune recession to increase.\u201d If Donald Trump truly believed that climate change was a hoax, then he would not want to spend extra money as a private businessman to protect himself from the (not real) risks of climate change.\n\n\n\n_____\n\n> *Hello, users of CMV!

While it's too early to call the upcoming election by any means in terms of who will actually win the title of President, I *think* it's pretty clear that it's going to be a Clinton V. Trump deal(I don't want to say for sure, the numbers seem to be pointing this way). \n\nI don't plan on voting for either as I don't foresee any big differences in my own life from either holding the seat, but one thought I can't help but hold is that a Trump presidency will be bad for Brown Americans. Indian, Pakistani, Lebanese(Admittedly some look more caucasian, but that's not really relevant), Persian, etc(I know there are A LOT more I'm missing out on). \n\nLooking at the footage of Trump supporters at rallies(although I've only seen a few videos, so this isn't necessarily representative of ALL Trump supporters) and the current global political climate specifically in regards to terrorism, I feel like a Trump presidency will inspire a lot more open prejudice towards Brown Americans whether they're Muslim or not. \n\nA lot of the basis of my view is when I think about the average American(even myself included), we don't really seem like the kind of people to try and differentiate between all ethnic groups and their various religious practices. As a result, I expect anyone who is of a brown tone of skin will face some form of discrimination for religious practices they may not even be associated with.\n\nTo sum up since I feel I might have rambled: If Trump is elected, a lot of hatred towards Brown people living in America will start to show itself whether it is accurate or not.\n\n\nedit: TO CLARIFY, I DO NOT BELIEVE TRUMP HIMSELF TO BE NECESSARILY RACIST. Just taking a glance at the groups he appeals to by playing on their fears in regards to terrorism, I believe the racism and ignorance of those groups will become more prevalent.\n\n\n_____\n\n> *Hello, users of CMV!

I have curly dark hair, dark eyes, olive skin, almond eyes, and the high cheekbones giving me the so-called \"Semitic smile\". Unfortunately, right now, I live in the U.S. and there appears to be a serious (10-25%) chance that Donald Trump will be our next president. Now, keep in mind, while he has not ventured beyond mild anti-Semitism of his own, he has still advocated for eerie measures against Muslims that echo the Nuremburg Laws that the Nazis implemented (and as we all know, the Jews were not the only targets of Hitler). In addition, his wife said that a journalist who was met with anti-Semitic death threats and statements that she should be put in an oven \"brought those comments on herself\". Clearly, Jews are on the chopping block under a Trump presidency, and if ultra-Orthodox types were to commit a large-scale terrorist attacks, we might be \"registered\" and God-knows-what else. I am aware that his daughter is a convert to Judaism, but all genocidal and racialist regimes make exceptions (even Nazi Germany) and I think Trump would be willing to kill all 7 million Jews in America except the ones he knows personally if it were politically expedient. He already has a \"Lion's Guard\" militia which appears to exist to serve him, and is clearly not above inciting political violence, even agreeing to pay the legal fees of those who commit it in his name. His supporters have manifested themselves to be equally bloodthirsty, cheering wildly whenever a protester is attacked and booing any arresting police officers. As such, as someone of visible Jewish descent, it would be in my best interest to hide my heritage both in words and in appearance, and to arm myself with the best rifle I can afford and sleep with it by my bedside (I have experience shooting them and will be 21 by Inauguration Day).

            "selftext": "Here's my bias: I'm a Christian, grew up Christian.  I also love science.  I have always been annoyed by loud-mouthed Christians' blind ignorance of science.\n\nLately I've been exploring atheism to examine it's arguments.  Many of the arguments for theism get shut down by atheists as 'God of the gaps' arguments; basically saying that someone is invoking belief in God to explain whatever can't be currently explained.  And for the most part, I agree with them.  Many arguments for theism really are 'God of the gaps' arguments, and therefore not very valid.\n\nOne of the reasons I still believe in God is science.  In my view, science is overwhelmingly beautiful and creative and holds to certain themes a little too well for existence to have begun randomly.  One of the themes is fine tuning.  The fundamental laws of physics are ruled by certain universal constants that were created in the first fraction of a second of the beginning of the universe.  The universe can only exist because these constants are so well fine tuned.\n\nI really do feel that this fine tuning is good evidence for a designer.  Some of the argument and some of the counter arguments can be found [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fine-tuned_Universe) .  I don't see this as a 'God of the gaps' argument, because instead of invoking God to explain a phenomenon, fine tuning seems to be confirming the hypothesis that someone made the universe.  I know that might sound a little circular, but I think of it as a thought experiment.  If the universe has a creator who wants us to know it's there, then we might speculate that it might do something interesting or amazing to leave clues for us.  That's not a very eloquent way of putting that argument, sorry.  \n\n\nTo me, the most credible counter argument is the multiverse theory.  If there are infinite universes, then obviously ours would inevitably be one of them.  But I can't for the life of me understand how that theory has any evidence behind it.  I don't understand how science, which is bound by our existence, can make any claim to how physics works outside of or before our existence.  It seems like atheistic scientists have just thrown down the word infinite like a trump card, just like religious scholars used to do with the word God.  edit:  I think what I'm talking about here is a Level II multiverse.  Thanks to u/JoshuZ1 for pointing me to [Tegmark](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiverse#Max_Tegmark.27s_four_levels).\n\nCMV.  I'm more than willing to hear any plausible explanation to this.  If you're an evangelistic atheist who knows science, here's your chance.\n\n\n\nDISCLAIMERS:\nWhile I do hold a science degree, my emphasis is on biology and chemistry.  I have a rudimentary understanding of physics, so any argument based on physics will have to be a little bit ELI5.\n\nI'm aware of top-down cosmology being another viable argument, but my understanding of quantum physics is even worse than my understanding of Newtonian physics, so any attempts at that will have to be more like ELI3.\n\nedit: To clarify, I'm not so much interested in arguing the Fine Tuning argument as I am understanding Multiverse Theory as an atheistic argument.\n\nedit 2: A number of people pointing out that since multiverse is a mathematical interpretation and not testable it can't be used to argue for or against a god.  I've definitely read arguments supporting atheism with the multiverse theory, but I can't remember where now.  I would post it here if I could.  My bad.\n\nFinal edit: what I've mostly learned is that I don't know what I'm talking about.  Clearly my very limited understanding of multiverse hypotheses is a barrier to forming a valid opinion.

            "selftext": "Full disclosure: I am a Bernie Sanders supporter. But I also will become a Hillary supporter once the convention is over. She's not the devil and in fact there's a lot to respect, especially if you actually are supporting Sanders for ideological reasons. But anyway, lots of people have been recently calling for Sanders to drop out now that his victory is all but mathematically impossible. But obviously that's not the only facet of the argument; otherwise they would have no basis for calling him to drop out. What they say is that Sanders staying in the race is preventing Democratic unity and keeping Clinton from making her general election pivot to Trump, who is now been focusing all his attention on Hillary as the Republican Party unites around him. The results of this, in the eyes of the Clintonites, are Hillary's troubling polling against Trump nationally and in battleground states. In both cases she is even losing, and when she's not the margin is razor thin most of the time. According to the Sanders detractors, this is the obvious result of Trump having a unified party while Clinton is still engaged in a grueling (despite wining by a landslide in all metrics) nomination battle. There are several flaws with this argument.\n\nFirst of all, Clinton vs. Trump polling has always been close, it's just that now people are paying attention since it's closer to the general and these two are the presumptive nominees. Even as Sanders praised Secretary Clinton and communicated to America how little he cares about her damn emails, Trump vs. Sanders was always a blowout compared to Trump vs. Clinton. That's because it has nothing to do with the state of the Democratic race, but with the candidates themselves. Hillary Clinton is simply a weaker candidate: she is more disliked and mistrusted than Sanders, and she has a whole lot of baggage with her. Yes, she is more ideologically appealing to independents, but the rise of Trump shows that ideology isn't necessarily the biggest factor when it comes to who you vote for. And that's not even mentioning the fact that Sanders does better with independents than Clinton.\n\nThe second flaw is that Democratic unity isn't even threatened. The Democratic party has spent the last four months voting for a candidate, and that candidate is the inevitable nominee. And the entire party leadership is behind her as well. Yes, Sanders voters are a sizeable chunk of the party, but most of them will go to Clinton once she is nominated. The Bernie or Bust movement is a vocal minority, that's it.\n\nLet me conclude by comparing this primary to 2008. That election was much more divisive. It was a much closer race and the Democratic establishment was essentially split on it. It was also nastier in tone, and also slugged on until the convention even as the loser had no chance of winning. There was also a presumptive Republican nominee (with *much* more support from his party and from the American people) who was in general election mode and attacking a divided Democratic field, lowering poll numbers for the eventual nominee. How did that one end? The loser endorsed the winner, brought over their supporters, and gave the Democrats an electoral landslide.",

            "selftext": "We often hear the narrative of \"white privilege\" and the idea that white people and white men specifically have more advantages than minorities and women. This narrative may be true in some regards, and may be exaggerated in others. My CMV isn't predicated on debating if this does or doesn't exist, that debate has been had and usually leads down a downward spiral. \n\nWhat I rather focus on is the idea that other demographics (not white men) have the opportunity to use their demographic as an excuse or justification that absolves them from anything they are doing. I'd like to outline one example below so you understand what I mean:\n\nI was reading through this [thread] (https://www.reddit.com/r/hillaryclinton/comments/4l90tt/its_not_fair_and_im_going_to_rant/) about a Hillary Clinton supporter being frustrated with a potential Bernie v. Trump debate and Hillary not getting her due respect, and they argue that it must be because she's a woman. Using the woman card here as a reason for why Hillary might not be doing so well gave me the idea that when a person is someone who isn't a White male, they can always imply that something doesn't go their way because of their demographic. \n\nIt dawned on me that say the scenario was flipped no one could ever say, oh this is happening to Bernie because he's a male. Maybe if Bernie was a minority they could say it's happening because of his race. Maybe if he was a different sexual orientation, they could say it's because of that. However there's no scapegoat ability for someone who is a straight white male. \n\nI can understand that racism and sexism and homophobia are still things that exist in this world. I can also understand that in cases these things are the reason why certain people feel a certain way about a person or their actions. However I find it quite troubling that there's this \"out card\" (if you will) that exists for every group other than straight white males. \n\nJust looking at the example above objectively, one can see a plethora of reasons for why someone might not support Hillary Clinton. However since she's a woman we must include that as a reason as well. \n\nWe can look at Trump and find plenty of reasons why people won't support him .However you'll never hear it's because he's a white male.\n\nThe fact that the former exists and the latter doesn't makes me believe that non-straight-white-males have the ability to always create a shadow of a doubt about the reaction to their actions by claiming discrimination. Even if discrimination is really nowhere to be found. This scapegoat ability exists for them but will never exist for straight-white-males. \n\nIf you believe that heterosexual white men do have the same scapegoating ability as other demographic groups, please CMV.\n\n\n_____\n\n> *Hello, users of CMV!

            "selftext": "In the past I've talked about how our abstract love for Democracy as an absolute good in the US is misguided. For one, we don't live in an absolute Democracy, and we wouldn't want to. An absolute Democracy is where 51% of people can vote to take away the freedoms of 49% of the people. That is certainly not how our country does, or was ever meant to work.\n\nAlong those lines, the founding fathers were suspicious of Democracy. The \"tyranny of the majority\" was something to be wary of, and a good chunk of Americans don't really consider that they actually only wanted a certain select group of people to be able to vote, and the idea of letting the 'masses' vote was regarded as something that could lead to a country dictated by the whims of fools.\n\nOf course, that was a different time. Nevertheless, we still have this incorrect idea of Democratic vote as the method which leads to the best decision. But just as the best move in a chess game will not be selected by a majority of unskilled chess players, this is not correct. The problem *really* is this: How do you decide who gets to vote, and who doesn't? And when you start to think about possible solutions, you realize there is no particularly great one. Any select class of people who get to vote will invariably vote to enhance their own interests and disenfranchise others who do not share that privilege. And any test or bar we set for voting is going to be difficult to keep free of corruption. Most importantly, what should the standard be? Intelligence? Education attainment? Service? It's quite easy to see the issues in all those. To paraphrase then: Democracy is the worst system...except for all the other ones.\n\nOr is it? I feel like I have a solid answer to the most difficult question: What the standard should be. The standard should be your ability to not be easily duped or manipulated by others.\n\nThink about it: It's independent of political party or general intelligence level, wealth, sex, age, etc. All it tests is if you can be persuaded to act against your own interests by others. And this is the real problem in our Democracy right now. The election of people to positions of power is largely dictated by the easily-learned science of persuasion. Scott Adams, the creator of the comic strip Dilbert, had an interesting, if brief, discussion of this on [Bill Maher last week](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rMERNoQm5DE). Intelligent, informed, rational people can disagree on the right course of action with regard to our society, but the problem has always been if a Hitler or a Mussolini or a Donald Trump comes along, with the ability to play the people capable of being easily played (yes, that's a loaded statement, but I stand by it). Remove that, and so many of the problems inherent in Democracy disappear.\n\nCertainly, it would not be perfect. As I suggested, you would have to keep it free from corruption. But I think a test to remove those most easily duped from the voting process absolutely would, despite our trained unease with the idea, make our society a better place to live. Am I wrong?",

            "selftext": "Im a Bernie supporter ONLY because Ive committed hours and hours to researching the candidates and he appears the most honest, experienced, and consistent person in the race. Im not closed-minded about this, and i regularly engage Hillary supporters online hoping to have courteous and intelligent debates. I always seek to learn something i didnt, and I try to give each person the chance to change my mind. No one has been able to do so... Every Hillary supporter Ive engaged has been condescending, ignorant, and evasive. They push the same warped arguments over and over, ignore my counterpoints completely, and then disappear into the mist once the feel cornered, only to pop up again somewhere else on facebook parrotting the same rhetoric. Its been extremely disturbing, especially since the mainstream media seems to push the idea that Bernies supporters are the ones who are always acting out. \n\nEdit: people have been confused by my phrasing. To clarify:\n\nConsidering shes the likely nominee, please sell me on her. Please give me well-thought out reasons as to why you honestly feel shes the best person to be the democratic candidate. Dont shy away from spirited debate, and come up with appropriate responses to my counterpoints. I dont need to agree with your end conclusion, but i want to see that the steps you made to reach that conclusion are sound. This is how you can change my view.\n\nEdit: im only interested in hearing from Hillary Clinton supporters. Not people that would vote for her instead of Trump, people who realllly support her and think shes done an amazing job and should without question be the next president.\n_____\n\n> *Hello, users of CMV!

My worries are that Trump is not a serious capitalist, basically.\n\nI'm out of options, though, because Gary Johnson is Pro-choice. \n\nSo it's either vote for Trump or no one. Here are my issues:\n\n* Trump has shown a total lack of respect for laissez-faire capitalism, and zero understanding of solid, non-interventionist economics. For example, he wants to do a trade war with China that will cripple our standard of living because it would hinder our ability to get so many cheap goods. Why should I, as a capitalist, vote for him?\n* Since he has zero political experience, how am I supposed to trust anything he says about being Pro-life? He could just be making it up to get elected. With zero votes or actions in political life, I can't trust him. Why do *you* trust him?\n* Trump is a \"negotiator\" which means he has no intention of getting his full tax plan implemented. So isn't he essentially just voting for more of the same, with maybe a little less taxes? And isn't there a high possibility that he could sell out capitalists and conservatives like myself because of his \"negotiations\"?\n\nInterested in what your responses are to these issues.",

He also plans to increase the tax on business' imports. Taxing imports will encourage more manufacturing in America, and American citizens with more disposable income, because of lower income taxes, will also encourage an increase in the supply of labor - less tax = more spending = more jobs to collect that spending. Hillary's presidency, on the other hand, is predicted to be much like Obamas, and thats not good. Income inequality and the national debt have both risen substantially during his presidency.\n\nIts true that Trump is vague about a lot of his policies - right now - but that will give him the upper hand in negotiating as our president. No one will be able to use \"his wants\" against him because they will not know what they are. \n\nTrump has turned millions of dollars in to billions, and we probably wouldn't even know who Hillary Clinton was if it wasn't for her husband. \n\nHe will make a better president.",

The value of an education is notoriously difficult to measure, but the only real objective standard by which an education can be judged is financial ROI. Ok, now let's say, for the sake of argument, that some Trump U students didn't get a good ROI. Now that sucks. But it's hardly unique or legally actionable.\n\nIt's standard practice at literally every university in the country to charge huge tuition fees for degrees of extremely dubious value like gender studies or medieval literature, or hundreds of other bullshit degrees that will never translate into a viable career path or provide any ROI whatsoever. The universities know full well that these degrees are worthless but continue to manipulate naive bright-eyed teenagers into taking on debt they can't afford and 4 years of time in these courses when they could be learning or doing something useful instead. \n\nNow, the standard counterargument is that education has \"intrinsic value\" besides ROI. OK, fine. So then the Trump U students have nothing to complain about because they got intrinsic value, even if they didn't make money off the degrees. \n\nIf, however, the intrinsic value argument doesn't wash, then where's the indictment for every other university in the country? Why is Trump U such a horrible scam, but they somehow aren't? \n\n *Hello, users of CMV! This is a footnote from your moderators. We'd just like to remind you of a couple of things.

As a matter of fact, I'm 17 years old, so I'm not even voting for this election! I have no political views currently (I don't identify with any party currently). I'm just calling out what I'm observing, and I really want genuine reasoning on why Donald Trump is a bad presidential cnadidate. THANK YOU!\n\n_____\n\n> *Hello, users of CMV!

            "selftext": "Howdy CMV,\n\nThis is something that has been really bothering me as the Reddit hivemind has really migrated toward being anti-Hilary no matter what. \n\nThere is a Republican nominee who:\n\n1. Is a literal billionaire. Don't like the billionaire class using money to influence politics? Well they can just run themselves now! The Kochs should have thought of this! (actually they tried and failed, but that's because they didn't run as republicans). He advocates cutting his own taxes, (http://www.politico.com/story/2016/05/donald-trump-taxes-tax-reform-223041), ending freedom of the press (http://www.politicususa.com/2016/02/27/trump-freedom-press-not-people.html), bringing back \"pre-existing conditions\" (http://www.forbes.com/sites/theapothecary/2016/03/03/the-most-important-thing-about-donald-trumps-health-reform-plan-is-that-donald-didnt-write-it/#3528989130a3)\n\n2. Wants to PURPOSELY murder terrorist sex slaves and their children. This is not only not progressive. It's probably the most immoral policy any presidential nominee has ever advocated- at least as bad as slavery. http://www.cnn.com/2015/12/02/politics/donald-trump-terrorists-families/\n\n3. Is an unapologetic racist against Latinos (http://www.cbsnews.com/news/election-2016-donald-trump-defends-calling-mexican-immigrants-rapists/) and Muslims (http://www.cnn.com/2015/12/07/politics/donald-trump-muslim-ban-immigration/). The KKK loves him! http://www.politico.com/story/2016/02/david-duke-trump-219777\n\nNone of this really gets into his potentially world destabilizing foreign policy or his view that POW's (often the soldiers that go on the most risky missions, risking their lives for their country) are losers, but I wanted to stay focused on \"progressive\" issues. \n\nLook, I know Hillary is crooked to some degree. I get it. She is not ideal for many of you, or even acceptable as a democratic nominee, but you don't play games with who you select as \"the leader of the free world\". Just because you are angry, you can't put this kind of person in power. It makes you worse than anyone running in this race right now.\n\nEDIT: Yes I know I misspelled \"Loses\". Sorry.\n\n_____\n\n> *Hello, users of CMV! This is a footnote from your moderators. We'd just like to remind you of a couple of things.

But fighting oppression requires more than just lip-service - it requires changing centuries-old views and ideologies, and getting others around you to change. This isn't easy, overnight work.\n\nI don't think it's good enough to argue that folks with privilege should \"be good people\" by becoming more actively anti-racist, anti-sexist, and so on. This is the PC trap - which in fact implies that they are currently *bad* people (not good enough), and stokes resentment - thus, Trump.\n\nIs there a more powerful, more sensible way to convince people with privileges to spend more time actively engaging in discussions around inequality across groups, and developing more of a sense of social justice in solidarity with those that are not like them? I'd love to hear your thoughts.\n_____\n\n> *Hello, users of CMV! This is a footnote from your moderators. We'd just like to remind you of a couple of things.

            "selftext": "Donald Trump is well-known for his outlandish statements and political incorrectness, and I believe his popularity is due PRIMARILY to the media coverage he has received on account of these statements. His comments on women, abortion etc. garner so much support because Feminists have been harping on for so long about how we should censor our speech and silence ANYTHING that we deem to be offensive. Trump is the conservative backlash against this tide of intolerance to freedom of speech. The support he has received goes to illustrate that people appreciate \"straight talkers\" (as they call him). Effectively, his supporters are drawn to his rejection of the social pressures instilled by this feminist agenda. I think there's plenty of evidence to support this - 15-20 years ago, casual racism, casual homophobia and casual sexism were widely accepted as normal behaviour. I could provide pages of anecdotal evidence, but I'm sure everyone has witnessed what I'm talking about in their life. Thus, a character like Trump would have just been considered overly affrontive and insensitive toward these people - he would be saying things not so extreme as to be outside the social norm, but extreme enough that people would find it hard to swallow. His success as a demagogue over the last year or so stems from the fact that feminism is pushing for a sort of political correctness that constrains freedom of speech, and Trump is the (over)reaction against these constraints.\n\nI know that there are other reasons for Trump's support, such as the fact that middle-aged male wages haven't risen in America for over 30 years, and that certain people are fearful of terrorism and so flock to the populist with simple solutions, but I believe his popularity, and publicity have stemmed from, as I said above, his rejection of this entrenched mindset of political correctness. Had this mindset not been in place, he wouldn't have received anywhere near the media coverage he did, and so he would have languished behind the career politicians with real economic and political solutions. Furthermore, a lot of his support stems from the fact that he hasn't been swayed and hasn't been forced to apologise in the wake of his (quite frankly outrageous) comments. He hasn't bent under that pressure, as many politicians, companies and celebrities have over the last few years.\n\nEdit: I would like to make it clear that I do not support Donald Trump, or advocate any of his views.\n_____\n\n> *Hello, users of CMV!

            "selftext": "Lifelong, and self-admittedly further right, Republican voter here trying to think tactically for 2020. Trump scares the shit out of me because I'm convinced he's a liberal feigning conservatism in order to get elected. The only thing he is all that conservative about is the wall, and we don't really have an issue with illegal immigration in Wisconsin, so it really doesn't bother me. His election, I believe, would derail our party and change us fundamentally for the worse, possibly for decades. I am a Scott Walker supporter and, barring Walker or the Pope explicitly saying \"Ralph, vote for Trump,\" I'm not about to ignore what Trump said about our state or my governor during the campaign.\n\nI had thought about voting Libertarian and was going to do so, but then I realized that, if they do well enough to get 5%, that'll hurt us in the 2020 general. The only time a liberal won our governor's office since the early 80's in Wisconsin was because a Libertarian stole otherwise rightfully Republican votes. I don't want a repeat of that nationally, but I can't in good conscience vote for a man who will ruin our party. As sickening as it sounds, my only real option aside from my voting might be to vote for a Democrat, but I'm having trouble with that.\n\nOn to my big questions then.\n\nWill Clinton be okay with not getting any Supreme Court picks through, or would she try to pull a FDR? I refuse to hand our state back over to the Democrats and we have several cases in the legal system that could do just that.\n\nWill Clinton find some way to end the Second Amendment? What are her plans to do so? How long would they take? Would states have a chance to act independently or would she try taking our guns away at the national level?\n\nIs she actually Christian?\n\nI've heard conflicting reports on her stance on abortion. Would she allow us to place our own state level restrictions and bans, or will she try to expand it?\n\nWould she sign a repeal of Obamacare?\n\nAs long as we retain control of the Courts, I think can tolerate 4 years in exchange for hopefully Scott Walker or Paul Ryan for 8. Ideally, we'd see another Tea Party style surge in 2018 which would help us take/keep more states going into redistricting. The last thing we need is Trump causing a reverse wave and putting Democrats in Governorship positions in the states we took in 2010. If we might lose the Court/Wisconsin, I don't really know what to do. I apologize if any of this sounds rude. I honestly can't stand the fact that I'm even THINKING of voting for a lib, let alone a Clinton, so it's hard to keep my language clean. Thanks for any clarification you can give in advance!\n\nEdit: I guess I'll be hesitantly waiting until the election and, in a worst case scenario, voting for Clinton. Thanks for helping me talk this out. I sure as hell don't like her and I'll ideally be voting for Scott Walker as a write in, but it's good to know a lot of my worries aren't completely justified. They are justified, but not to their fullest worst case levels.",

I don't doubt that Trump feels he himself could not be impartial if the situation was reversed therefore he doesn't think this judge could be impartial. Not because Trump thinks Mexicans or Latinos are  inferior to him but the same as him.\n\n* Second this is about nationalism not racism.  Trump isn't implying that Mexicans cannot ever be Impartial he is implying that no one can be impartial when someone is \"attacking\" their homeland. If Trump was bad-mouthing France and trying to get the French removed from the EU, and his judge was of French decent he would make the same stupid comment\n\n* Lastly for something to be racist it has to imply one race is inferior to another. Not only is Mexican not a race but nowhere does trump imply that any nationality or race could do a better job in the same situation.  He is saying if person x is bad mouthing country y, then someone with country y heritage cannot be impartial.  ",

            "selftext": "This election has/will have two major candidates, Trump and Clinton. \n\nTo me, Clinton has held many positions but with very little to show for it. No major legislation as a senator and a foreign policy that was unremarkable at best. I don't doubt she's a policy expert and probably makes a very very ideal adviser. However, her decision-making skills and general likability really make me question her effectiveness as a President.\n\nI think Trump's past year speaks for itself on why he shouldn't be president.\n\nThis leaves many people in the position of voting for the lesser of two evils. The argument is often that a vote for a third party is a wasted vote and helps the greater evil win. That may be a fine argument if you live in Florida or Ohio, but in reality, your vote doesn't matter at all if you live in MA, NY, VT, OK, MS, AL, and so forth. In any solidly blue or red state, your vote for the lesser of two evils has no impact at all. **It doesn't matter that you voted.** However, it could matter if you voted for a third party. Federal funding for parties is based off of the popular vote (above 5% needed). It also drums up much needed awareness of these other parties and could help spread the word about them.\n\nWhy is Trump running on a GOP ticket? Because its a waste of time to run as anything besides the two major parties. The rules and odds are stacked so far against them that the easiest way into the Oval Office is by running on a major ticket. Bernie Sanders, a longtime independent has also shown this. If he was reasonably able to run on a third party ticket, then I'm sure he would and could avoid the Democratic Party's hoops. People talk about the primaries like they're rigged, but they're not. This is an independent organization that has chosen Hillary Clinton long ago. Bernie almost broke it like Trump did, but it is VERY difficult. \n\nVoting for a third party is voting against this system. It's voting against the status-quo Hillary and is voting to give people like Trump or Bernie a real chance **without destroying the central parties**. This is the real strategic vote, at least for blue/red staters. If enough people voted with this mentality, it would likely not alter the outcome and provide a better situation for future elections. \n\nFringe, populist candidates will be forced into the two \"mainstream\"/centrist parties, radicalizing them because there is no other outlet for them. Their supporters are fanatics and much more vocal than the centrists and will inherently take over the parties by radicalizing them through hatred of the other side. Hillary Clinton, a \"project\" groomed for 30 years for this situation is only barely beating an elderly man that came out of nowhere. This will continue to happen to greater and greater extents unless there's another outlet.\n\n_____\n\n> *Hello, users of CMV! This is a footnote from your moderators.

I think he's terrible, and I would rather the honor of \"first god-emperor\" go to someone who deserves it.\nHowever, there's no way around the fact that it's either Clinton or Trump, and that's not Trump's fault. It hurts to admit, but Cruz lost. Even if there was some voter suppression along the way, that's not the reason he won. He won because he's fighting the establishment, whether you like it or not. The alternative this year is Clinton. We don't have a \"democracy,\" we have two candidates that we hate, and whining won't change it. If Donald were the one holding this gun to my head screaming \"Do you want Clinton to win,\" then I might say screw him, but as it stands, it's the nation as a whole that's holding that gun.\n\n**TL;DR: A vote for anyone other than Trump is a vote for Clinton, regardless of which one is actually worse.**\n\n_____\n\n> *Hello, users of CMV!

            "selftext": "There's been a ton of talk recently about how voting for a third party is a vote for Trump/Hillary (depending on which that person prefers). Basically since I can remember the elections have seemed stale and the candidates lazy in fulfilling promises. I believe this is because the two major parties have gotten used to always depend on a reliable voting base to get their party close to winning the election. Essentially both sides know that all they have to do is be slightly less shitty than their opponent and they will get the required number of independent voters to win. Part of the reason this idea is prevalent is that people have this mentality that you have to vote for one or the other or else the other person is going to win. Basically my CMV is that the only way to break this cycle of having shitty candidates who only use attack ads and generally are unworthy to be president is to show them that the American people are willing to vote for who they actually believe in, even if they don't have a chance to win. This is because they know for almost an absolute certainty that independent voters will vote for one of the two parties. If we start to vote for who we really believe is the best choice instead of picking the lesser of two evils then both major parties will have to work harder to get those votes back from the pool of independents. Essentially we as the electorate need to force more competition. No this may take a couple of election cycles to really make a difference but I believe this election is a crucial place to start since both candidates are almost universally hated by people on all sides of the political spectrum. It doesn't matter who it is you vote for in this case, all that matters is that you tell the parties that your vote is NOT a guaranteed blue or red. Even if one or the other is still going to win it will be worth it to force competition, and thus get better candidates from both parties in the future (or else they will decidedly lose against the party that does listen and actually nominates a good candidate).\n\n> *Hello, users of CMV!

Hillary is a life long politician. She's done the same thing.

            "selftext": "For a few days I've been hearing about how Trump made racist remarks about the judge in the Trump University case. I just kind of assumed that he went a little off script and started saying things that he shouldn't . \n\nAfter a while I got curious about what he actually said. I tried to find a quote, but it was nearly impossible. Every article would have a paragraph of commentary and just a word or two from the speech in quotation marks, but not even a complete sentence.\n\nIt took a while, but I finally tracked down a transcript of the speech. It was a bit rambling because it was off the cuff remarks at a pep rally, but I did not find one racist thing in it. He was upset that he felt that he wasn't being treated fairly by this specific judge. He did call the judge \"Mexican\", but Mexican is not a slur. In fact he says he is \"Mexican, which is great\".  \n\nSo, can you change my view? Is there another statement that Trump made about this case that I haven't seen?\n\nI'm including a transcript because it was so hard for me to track down. \n\n\n>Does everybody have a little time? [cheers and applause] so I end up with a lawsuit, and it ends up in San Diego in federal court. It is a disgrace the way the federal court is acting, because it is a simple lawsuit. Everybody that took the so-called course. Trump University is in San Diego. The trial, they wanted it to start while I am running for president. The trial is going to take place sometime in November. There should be no trial. This should have been dismissed on summary judgment easily. Everybody says it, but I have a judge who is a hater of Donald trump. He\u2019s a hater. His name is Gonzalo Curial. And he is not doing the right thing. I figure what the hell? Why not talk about it for two minutes. Should I talk about it? Yes? [cheers and applause] so we should have won. . . .\n\n>But I am getting railroaded by a legal system, and frankly they should be ashamed. I will be here in November. Hey, if I win as president, it is a civil case. I could have settled this case numerous times. But I don\u2019t want to settle cases when we are right. I don\u2019t believe in it. When you start settling cases, do you know what happens? Everybody sues you because you get known as a settler. One thing about me, I am not known as the settler. And people understand with this whole thing, with this whole deal with the lawyers, class action lawyers are the worst. It is a scam. Here is what happens. We are in front of a very hostile judge. The judge was appointed by by Barrack Obama \u2013 federal judge. [Boos]. Frankly he should recuse himself. He has given us ruling after ruling, negative, negative, negative. I have a top lawyer who said he has never seen anything like this before. So what happens is we get sued. We have a Magistrate named William Gallo who truly hates us. The good news is it is a jury trial. We can even get a fully jury. We are entitled to a jury, and we want a jury of 12 people. And you are going to watch. First of all, it should be dismissed. Watch how we win it was I have been treated unfairly. Very much like with the veterans, where I raised all that money, but on Tuesday I am announcing all of the groups we are giving almost $6 million to. You turn things around. Here is the story. We have a law firm named Robin Skeller. It is the spin-off of two law firms. Two of those partners went to jail for an extended period of time for doing very bad things legally. This same group is the lawyers against. So what happens is the judge, who happens to be, we believe Mexican, which is great. I think that is fine. You know what? I think the Mexicans are going to end up loving Donald Trump when I give all these jobs. I think they are going to love it. I think they are going to love me. . . .\n\n>A lot of people said before you run you should settle. I said I don\u2019t care. The people understand it. And they use it. So when I have 10,000 people, and when we have mostly unbelievable reviews, how do you settle? And in fact, when the case started originally, I said how can I settle when I have a review like this? Now I should have settled, but I am glad I didn\u2019t. I will be seeing you in November either as president. And I will say this. I have all these great reviews, but I will say this. I think Judge Curiel should be ashamed of himself. I think it is a disgrace he is doing this. I look forward to going before a jury, not this judge, and we will win that trial. We will win that trial. Check it out. Check it out, folks. You know, I tell this to people.  November 28. I think it is scheduled for. It should not be a trial. It should be a summary judgment dismissal. . . .\n\n>It is a disgrace. It is a rigged system. I had a rigged system, except we won by so much. This court system, the judges in this court system, federal court. They ought to look into Judge Curiel because what Judge Curiel is doing is a total disgrace. Ok? But we will come back in November. Wouldn\u2019t that be wild if I am president and come back and do a civil case? Where everybody likes it. Ok. This is called life, folks. . . .",

Before I start I'm not a liberal basher, or a racist Trump supporter, although I believe he speaks his mind too much I feel he doesn't mean everything he says (of course that doesn't matter to some). \n\nOk, to begin, his tax plans will help the middle class, period, if one makes $50,000 will have NO income tax. Now, some may say \"Little revenue will come in due to lax of taxes.\" He also wants to end all wars and aid to countries. He is the only Republican who agrees Bush's wars were a mess and a huge waste of money and that's VERY good to know. Hillary's plans are similar to Obama's which will end up with the working class paying more in taxes. \n\nTrump also doesn't support TPP (similar to NAFTA) where Hillary does. It has costs Americans MANY jobs. He is dedicated to giving Americans the jobs they deserve and bringing them back which leads to my third point.\n\nTrump wants to decrease the corporate tax rate, which is second highest in the world next to Japan (who also has one of the highest gdp to debt ration, likes us *tisk tisk). Lowering this would allow corporations to pay their taxes as well as bring jobs back to America.\n\nMy last point is that he really cares for the American people. He wants to enforce immigration laws for illegal aliens who get entitlements and wants law and order. To me, I don't how one can logically hate Trump for this. If you illegally cross Mexico, you get 15 years in prison, they also have borders for Guatemala, does that make them racists? NO! Also, about the Syrian Refugees, we've funded Middle East countries, they need to take care of that mess, and when you bring up \"we created ISIS.\" understand it was for means of Democracy and now it's time for militias and countries we've funded to take care of this mess and bring our troops home.\n\nHillary has lied about too many things, doesn't care for the working class and wants to raise taxes for them, has deals to ruin American jobs, under Federal investigation, etc (I can go on if you'd like)",

I thought we should not only get money out of politics, but I wanted to get politicians out of politics and have a direct democracy. In my heart I still want that, but I've concluded we can't handle it. America is simply too stupid.\n\nDemocracy only works if we have a very disciplined, well informed public. Not one that can be persuaded by a 30 second campaign ads and bumperstickers.\n\nI mean Trump supporters are unamerican nationalists. But the [democrats aren't much better](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eiZFXkmofgI). At least the Trump supporters know what they stand for.\n\nWe really don't deserve the democracy we have. It's a beautiful decentralized system of checks and balances, designed to distribute power from the bottom up. Yet nobody knows who their assemblyman is, or what a state assembly even does, for that matter. I know I didn't for most of my voting life.\n\nI'm tempted to believe our national ignorance is due to lack of education. But we spend 12 years learning social studies and they fail to teach us about our basic political structure. We simply graduate believing we elect a president to act as king. \n\nSo please change my view. It sucks to be this cynical.\n\n_____\n\n> *Hello, users of CMV!

            "selftext": "Hello everyone,\nUsing a throw away because this topic can get pretty touchy these days.\n\nFirst of all, I am an immigrant myself (to a country that isn't the US). It's been hell to come here legally, there are several limitations placed on me, under the threat of being deported (I can't go to college/university, I have work limitations, I can't leave the country, etc). It's been a very rough year and a half dealing with it, so it doesn't make me too happy seeing people just getting a free pass.\n\nI think almost everyone can agree that the immigration system is broken. But I can not understand why it has become so controversial to want to deport illegals. At the end of the day, they did cut in line, they didn't pay the appropriate fees and a lot of them are getting benefits from the american system.\n\nAnd from the point of view of the people, it must really suck to be considered illegal/undocumented, there is a whole stigma attached to it, I am sure some of them are terrified of ever being caught, and I really feel for the children or who came very young and may have grown in the country and are now being threatened.\n\nWith all that being said, I feel the government has done little to nothing to solve the issue, there is a lot of [conflicting information around the internet](https://www.google.ca/webhp?sourceid=chrome-instant&ion=1&espv=2&ie=UTF-8#q=Obama+told+people+not+to+deport), but I have heard that there was an order not to deport people, and there is the whole [sanctuary city problem which, if I understand correctly, is where people aren't deported](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sanctuary_city).\n[People are actually coming out and wearing the fact that they are undocumented proudly and benefiting from the American system](http://www.nytimes.com/2016/06/11/us/2-valedictorians-in-texas-declare-undocumented-status-and-outrage-ensues.html)\n\nI honestly think this makes the problem even worse! \n\nSo now the result of this alleged inaction, is that we have somewhere around 11 million illegals floating around our country. What I question is, what is the point of calling them illegal  or undocumented and not take any action? Either deport them or put a system in place that just gives amnesty to people who come from certain countries (perhaps Mexico, Haiti, other Latin American countries that are going though problems?) while maintaining the border (wall or no wall!).\n\nPersonally I find deporting everyone like Trump would suggest economically undoable and simply not fair for people who came in as children and have been fine for the country. But, we do have rules in place and if they aren't going to fulfill them, what is the point in even having them? If we want to keep it, follow up and deport people as they are caught, if not, make amnesty laws from certain countries!\n\nThanks for listening please CMV!\n\n_____\n\n> *Hello, users of CMV!

So instead of an ideological net loss of only 25, you have an ideological net loss of 75. \n\nSo at most what you're holding on to is ideological purity, or principles beholden to your beliefs.

But majority of the places this censorship happens is on left-wing platforms like REDDIT, FACEBOOK and TWITTER which were all created by and heavily populated with liberal leftists. \n\nIf conservatives like Trump supporters don't like the way these liberal dominated social platforms operate they should go create their own. Why should Mark Zuckerberg who's an open liberal leftists have to cater to conservatives? It's his company, he can do what he wants with it and maybe he wants to censor Donald Trump pages. \n\nThis is very hypocritical of the right in the way that they are the first to complain about how Immigrants come into their country then try to establish their own culture. Well, conservatives shouldn't go to platforms owned and operated by leftist then try to promote their political viewpoints and complain when they are shut down. \n\nIn the words of the co-founder of reddit: *\"Neither Alexis nor I created reddit to be a bastion of free speech, but rather as a place where open and honest discussion can happen.\"*\n_____\n\n> *Hello, users of CMV!

            "selftext": "I've been thinking about this for a while but the attack in Orlando (and people's response to it) has only solidified my opinion.\n\nFor the past year or so I have been following right-wing personalities, pages, forum, etc especially from what is known as the Alt-right. For those who are unfamiliar they are basically fascists with a different name. They advocate for the killing of immigrants and Muslims in particular. But they also follow the Jewish conspiracy idea as well and call for the \"purging of degenerates.\" If you are white and disagree with them they label you a cuck which is their term for race traitor. If you want to look up more on what they are all about go to r/pol, the Facebook page Radical Patriarch, and ReturnofKings.com. There are many others but you'll get the point from here. \n\nThese people would not be an issue if it wasn't for the fact candidates who have similar views are running for office across the West. They are sadly no longer fringe. These people LOVE Donald Trump and he has shown to be receptive of this by retweeting their accounts and dog whistling. They view the very existence of minorities, feminists, homosexuals and people who they label as \"degenerates\"  as an affront. the violence at Trump rallies and by Trump supports outside of them highlights two realities. 1. If elected Trump will either carry out violence against non-cishet whites (and whites who disagree with them)/permit people to commit the violence with little repercussion. 2. If he loses the race his supporters will retaliate through violence. \nI also want to make clear that this is more than just Trump. He is the vehicle for the alt-right and other far-right groups. Even without him the threat is still present. \n\nThe government has proven itself inept at preserving the lives of minorities whether it be in the terror attack in Orlando or the many black lives that have been gunned down by the state, or the massacre at the Sikh temple in Wisconsin because the terrorist thought he was killing Muslims. A Trump or other rightist presidency will only exacerbate the problem. Fascists only seem to respond to violence or the threat of violence so we have been left with no other options (unless you can convince me that there are) other than to take steps to protect ourselves. \n\nWhen the militias threatened a Mosque in Texas with an armed mob the Huey Newton Gun Club was there to defend them. As a result they backed off. When Ossian Sweet was faced with being lynched in 1920's Detroit he saved himself and his family with his gun. These are some examples of how guns can be used in a positive way to protect our rights from an extreme conservatism that threatens white nationalism and subjugation of minorities, homosexuals, and women. \n_____\nhttp://thescoopblog.dallasnews.com/2016/04/tense-anti-mosque-protest-draws-armed-demonstrators-in-south-dallas.html/",

            "selftext": "A friend of mine commented yesterday that mass shootings always revive the gun debate, and wondered aloud whether government (federal, state, or local) would take action to regulate guns. My attitude is that there is no real debate over gun control: it's been over since Sandy Hook. The shooter there targeted small children, and after a few months of hand-wringing, we all collectively shrugged and accepted that this is just how things work in the US. If dead schoolchildren can't inspire voters to action, nothing will. There is no group of people that could possibly inspire more sympathy or outrage. In Orlando, the victims were patrons of an LGBTQ club, and to say that a significant portion of Americans doesn't entirely sympathize with the LGBTQ community would be an incredibly mild description of the situation. \n\nThe bottom line is, this is what normal is in America. The debate is over. We can talk about this, complain, yell at each other, call each other names, and propose all sorts of compromises. But none of it will lead to anything being done. It's possible that one day a Supreme Court decision could affect things, but that's about as far from voter and legislative-centered action as you can get. \n\nTHINGS I AM NOT DEBATING HERE: \n* The efficacy of gun control measures\n* The efficacy of non-gun-control \"solutions\" to gun violence, such as: \"let's just ALL carry guns all the time\"\n* What Trump thinks about gun control\n* What Hillary thinks about gun control\n* What Bernie thinks about gun control\n* What the Framers would think about gun control\n* The necessity/wisdom of citizens remaining prepared for potential armed revolt against the US government at all times\n* Whether this is all the NRA's fault\n* Whether this is all Islam's fault\n* Whether this is all men's fault\n* The \"real meaning\" of the Second Amendment\n* Which side of the debate understands the Constitution better\n* Whether it's right/good/moral to want changes in US gun laws\n\nAnd so forth. It's not that I don't have opinions on any of these things: I just don't presently hate myself enough to want to debate them on the internet with strangers. I'll let you know if that changes. If your argument includes any of the things listed above, I will probably not give you the sort of response you are looking for.\n\nWhat I'm trying to say here is that when we're done feeling shitty about Orlando, we're going to let out a deep sigh and go back to whatever we were doing before, and repeat the cycle when the next big shooting happens. Gun control proponents lack the political will and power to accomplish anything meaningful (I'm intentionally discounting local and some state governments here: gun control in one city is meaningless when all it takes is an hour's drive to circumvent it), and anti-gun control advocates seem to regard a certain number of innocent lives lost as simply the price of their freedom to own guns. Collectively we'd rather continue going through this every month or so than risk being even a little bit inconvenienced when we try to buy a gun, and this tragic event will not change that. This is what normal in America looks like, and what it will continue to look like for quite some time to come.\n\nCMV: convince me that something about this one is different, and we're actually going to do something this time. \n_____\n\n> *Hello, users of CMV!

I don't believe Obama was guilty of 'politicizing' the Sandy Hook school shooting when he had victims' families appear behind him during a speech, either.\n\nI believe politicizing something is wrong if it's by means of using a tragedy to promote unrelated legislation, but I don't believe this is the case with Obama's response to Sandy Hook, or Trump's response to Orlando, or most comments accused of politicizing.",

            "selftext": "People who consider themselves a member of the \"elites\" in Western, English-speaking political systems should stop using that term to describe themselves.\n\nA lot of the political tumult playing out today -- the rise of Donald Trump, the success of the Brexit campaign, to take two examples -- seems to pit the so called \"elites\" (ie, members or sympathisers of the Establishment) against what I understand to be \"the common people\". \n\nElites seem frustrated by the fact that their ideas are being increasingly rejected by the electorate. They scratch their heads and ask \"How can so many people support Trump\" and \"Why can't more people see that remaining in the EU is better for the UK\".\n\nI think PART of the problem is that proponents of those positions are commonly referred to as \"the elites\". \n\n\"Elite\" is just incendiary, arrogant, tone-dead and (ultimately) self-defeating term to use.\n\nInherently, it elevates those people above those who don't share those views. It offends the egos of those who happen to disagree with \"the elites\" on a given issue. At that point, the objective merit of the view espoused by the elites becomes almost irrelevant. It's now a matter of pride.\n\nImagine if someone was trying to persuade you on an issue, and they described themselves (or the media characterised them) as \"elite\". That is an insult to you, because it suggests your opponent is somehow better than you. When you are so insulted, you're probably more likely to dig in on your view just to stick it to those arrogant assholes. This actually hurts the cause of elites, whose view on an issue may be objectively and factually \"better\". It actually strengthens the position of their opponents by shifting the issue's battleground from facts to matters of self-identity, teams and partisanship.\n\nThe Establishment is almost always going to have a united view of certain issues. I'm not trying to deny or question that. I'm simply saying that members of the Establishment should no longer be described as \"elites\".\n\nCMV by convincing me that the term \"elite\" does not in fact insult non-elites, or that non-elites are not in fact influenced at all by the fact that their opponents are described using an elevatory word.",

            "selftext": "For those who remember, during Clinton's presidency Fox News slowly began offering an arguably biased alternative to the news, slowly cultivating an oppressed mindset in conservative viewers. \n\nThe triumphant election of George W Bush turned the network into basically, the unofficial white house spokeschannel. Numerous policies could be used as an example, but in general they created an \"our way or the highway\" attitude that was ingrained by a 24 hour news cycle. They cultivated anger and righteousness, and often used sleazy tactics... Like the Question Mark. For example: \n\n\"Is B. Hussain Obama secretly a radical Muslim?\" as a headline, absolving themselves of libel by posing it as a question. \n\nTo quote the Daily Show: Fox News, not racist, but #1 with racists\n\nThis angry, conservative, fact proof echo chamber has prevented them from having real discussion within their ranks, and only really works when they're \"winning.\" At this point, as schisms erupt between the fiscal and social conservatives, the anger train has left the station and split their vote, ending in Donald Trump: A loud, rich, angry white man who says whatever he needs to say to stay in the media while shattering the establishment's ability to maintain control over the beast they created. \n_____\n\n> *Hello, users of CMV!

            "selftext": "CMV: I am a left-leaning libertarian according to the political compass test and I agree with that.  For an easy summary, I lie somewhere within the views of Sam Harris, Dave Rubin, a little Douglas Murray, and Carl Benjamin (Sargon of Akkad [yeah yeah say what you want, but he isn't wrong]) (except that I am very pro gun).  At the start of this election, I was convinced that I was either going to vote independent or democrat.\n\nI was definitely not going to vote democrat if Hillary was the nominee.  Not only am I tired of the establishment politicians, but I don't think it's a secret that Hillary is corrupt and blatantly lies for political gain.  After she lies she denies that she's held her original position in the first place.  I just don't see myself voting for someone like that.  In my opinion, she is far worse than Trump.  (If you can convince me to change my view about Hillary - bonus points, but that will be very difficult.)\n\nTo start, I had become very disenchanted with the left.  I didn't notice when it happened, but they seemed to start valuing victim groups over actual logic.  They would call people sexist when they weren't sexist.  They would call people racist when they weren't racist.  They would support people who were just wrong because they were part of a 'marginalized community'.  They also refuse to even talk about the problem of radical Islam when it is so obvious that many people made a running joke out of it whenever they denied it.  All in all, it just seemed that they had abandon facts for feelings and that isn't what I wanted in a political party...\n\nNow on to Trump... When Donald Trump first started his campaign I was very against him.  I thought he was going to be just like every other politician up there, but as I saw him more and more I thought \"this guy is hilarious, there's no way he's going to win though\".  Sure enough, he won and I was laughing about it.  My thoughts were \"This guy who doesn't practice speeches, who just speaks his mind at his rallys , who doesn't care what other people think just decimated 17 other politicians at their own game.\"  I kind of liked that, but I wasn't all the way there...\n\nI didn't even really start listening to his Trump until I saw how the anti-Trump protesters physically assaulted his supporters and the media spun it to make it look like the supporters were the bad guys... that pissed me off.  I can't be on the side of people who assault others for political opinions in America, but worse than that, I couldn't side with the media who lied about what was actually happening when the evidence was there for anyone to see.\n\nAt this point, I really sat down and listened to Trump.  I admit I was primed to really agree with him because of the everything that happened, but I did try to go into it with an open mind.  Though I didn't agree with everything, it seemed like this guy didn't care who he offended... he just wanted to get the job done.  It seemed like he had specific things that he wanted to fix, and even though he didn't know exactly how to do these things, he wasn't going to pander to anyone else to get them done.  As a bonus, he had left leaning policies that I was very OK with.  It looks like he sees things that were wrong in the country and he wants to do what he feels is best for America.\n\nSo here is were you can try to convince me to change.\n\nHere are the views I agree with him on:\n\n- illegal immigration.  I agree we need to do something about it.  Calling everyone racist who is against undocumented immigrants is not productive.  What can we actually do about this problem?  \"Build a wall\" isn't the most intelligent answer, but no one else is talking about a solution.  Mexican drug cartels can move massive amounts of heroin across the boarder and nothing is done about it.  (End the drug war?  Trump is for that.)  I also think we should try to get the best immigrants in our country, not just whoever wants to come because they happen to slip across our boarder.  I don't agree with splitting up families, but if an illegal immigrant commits a crime, they have to go.\n\n- bad deals for the US (that our politicians got us into) - This is a biggest one for me.  To get our economy back on track, America needs to make the best deals for itself.  We need to make deals that ensure our country's survival.  It seems like the current politicians will cave to corporations (or whoever gives them money) rather than the people's needs when negotiating *anything*.  Putting America first is the most important thing when it comes to these type of deals and I think Trump has the experience and the attitude to accomplish this.  We are very deep in debt with no plan to pay it off.  Enough of corruption and money in politics.\n\n- radical Islamic terrorism - *Everyone* knows this is a problem, but no one wants to say anything about it.  I think this is more political correctness rearing its head, but we need the middle eastern countries to deal with this.  We can't keep accepting people with horrible views pumped into their brains and reinforced by their imams at their mosques.  Islam needs a reformation, and until that happens we should not be so open to let that ideology spread through our country.  I'm not saying ban all Muslims and I don't think Trump means that either (you may disagree, but I think his intentions are to postpone immigration from problem countries), but we have to do something (maybe something like the Israeli system?).\n\n- I agree with other things too, like ending the extreme political correctness, ending the drug war, etc., but the above 3 are most important to me.\n\nThings I disagree with Trump on:\n\n-Global Warming - This is clearly a problem, denying it is stupid.  This is one of the main reasons I was hesitant to back *any* republican for years.\n\n-Surveillance / NSA - I can't get on board with this.  I know it can be used for good, but it has been shown to be used for more nefarious means in the past.\n\n-Imminent domain - I think there needs to be a good balance of this in our country.  The government can't just take your land if you don't want them to, but there needs to be room for communities to grow... I think Trump rides this a little too hard.\n\nThese things are not my favorite, but they are outweighed by the things that I like.\n\nOh, and I don't think Trump is racist, he just tries to talk like any other person talks.  My opinion is that if someone tries to convince me from that angle they are being disingenuous.\nI don't care about 'rhetoric' or offending anyone.  I want results and the status quo in my opinion is unacceptable.\n\nSo, that is a short summary of my thoughts on this.  Also, in case anyone wants to call me a racist or something, I was actually hoping for the it to be Bernie vs Trump, that way we at least see something change no matter what.  Nothing to do with race.\n\nFinal thoughts: a heads up to anti-Trump people, when you insult people for holding a political opinion, it doesn't make them want to change their mind.  It actually drives more people away because they see you as a condescending douche who doesn't even address the issues.  You may think it's funny to laugh at people who you perceive to be less intelligent than you, but when people see you not addressing what they've said and insulting them, it makes you look bad.  People are tired of the lies about others being racist or sexist or whatever.  Those words poison the conversation.\n\nEDIT: I will be back to answer more questions later.  I have read all the responses so far and many were compelling.  I will respond when I am able.\n\nEDIT 2: OK, I think I've taken enough punishment for now.  I will continue to reply and issue deltas when I get a chance.  BTW, I was originally going to vote for John McAfee or Gary Johnson.  I think I found the reason why I had the change of heart: I jumped on the anti-PC bandwagon because I saw some stuff that made me very upset about the left and I really didn't want it to continue.  I thought the cost of keeping the status quo was too great.  The harassment of Trump supporters and the media cover up plus the ultra PC stuff just got to me.  So I went for the most anti-PC candidate out there.\n\nI guess I will vote for Gary or John even though I know they don't have a shot, but I will do it with a clear conscience.  I still agree with what I said above, but I have been persuaded that Trump really doesn't line up with the way I see these things.\n\nOh, and reddit may hate me for this but sometimes, I think r/The_Donald is funny... sometimes.\n\n_____\n\n> *Hello, users of CMV!

            "selftext": "Hello,\n\nFirst of all I would like to say that large chunks of the US population simply does not want to live with each other. This is mostly due to the increased latin population within the US. I would like to clarify that I don't think this is a moral or immoral stance, I just think that this is the reality of the situation. Now to get to my points:\n\n* The US has always been the land of the free and home of the brave. It has always been the beacon of success or **the standard** for class mobility..aka the American dream. I think all of these monikers and terminology have to have the stipulation that the US is the land of the free **if you are ethnically White**. Ask black people in this country if they felt the American dream was alive during slavery. Ask them if they felt that the US's golden age(the 50's and 60's) was a great era for Black people living under Jim Crowe laws. I think you will find that they don't view the US in the same manner.\n\n\n* The whole \"we kept our doors unlocked at night and talked to our neighbors all the time\" notion of the 50's and 60's only applied to White people. Naturally, White people got along and empathized more with white people. Racial relations between Whites and Blacks was **not better 50 years ago**. \n\n* Latin immigration is changing the demographic makeup of this nation. I believe they are currently around 16-20%, and is looking to be about 33% in 20 years. They were 2% of the population in the 60s. \n\n* White Americans(and the upper class Asian immigrants) simply don't want to live with Latin people, and specifically a Latin dominated culture. They simply don't sympathize with them as much. That is OK(for the society) when the population is around 2% and they don't really have any influence. That is completely different when the population spikes up to 20%. When a large subset of people don't want to live with 20% of the population makeup, it causes issues that we are just starting to see. \n\n* I live in San Diego, and this is clear as day to me. The culture gap between middle-upper class whites and asians vs the latinos is huge. In San Diego, there is essentially a freeway (the 8) that draws a line between the Mexican population(south of the 8) and the White suburban population(north of the 8). They almost never intermingle. You will almost never see people living north of the 8(for those of you familiar with San Diego, places like La Jolla, Del Mar, Poway etc.) going down to the heavily Mexican neighborhoods to socialize. It's almost as if there are two different worlds. I forgot who quoted it but it rings true  \"Black America is a world of difference from White America\". \n\n\n* Inability to empathize with minorities(blacks and hispanics) are the fundamental block to any socialist policies to help the nation. I'm sure you've all heard it: **why should my tax dollars go to some lazy minority who exploits the welfare system**. This is impeding social change for things like Universal healthcare, an increased wage, affirmative action etc. \n\n* Hispanic assimilation into the US has not been successful in the past 20 years. They have increased numbers significantly and yet we have become more polarized as a country. I think the amount of support that Donald Trump is getting is very telling about this notion. \n\n* The Media exacerbates all these problems. They have one goal only, and that is to get clicks for revenue. Do you know what is the best way to do that? Divide people so they argue over a hot topic. The media is in the business of dividing and polarizing the country because it makes them more money. \n\n* Having a tribal attitude towards other races is innate to human nature. We may always tell each other that we can get along....or that America is the great melting pot....but history seems to indicate otherwise. It's not just unique to America, Europe is currently experiencing it with the influx of Middle Easterners. I can't think of one massive immigration between Whites and Non whites that wasn't riddled with violence(Reconquista, the Levant area, the Balkans, American colonization etc. ). \n\n\n\nI know I'm kinda rambling but I just wanted to get it out there. I think all of this viewpoints lead to the idea that, as long as hispanic immigration persists at these numbers, the country will become further polarized and white people will not want to live with the ever expanding hispanic population. It's not right or wrong, it's just human nature because it's a clash of civilizations. History has taught us that almost anytime you get such massive demographic changes, it is almost always accompanied with lots of violence. \n_____\n\n> *Hello, users of CMV!

As I say, everything I learned about the American I've learned with their attitudes towards gun control, and I'm sure that if I could somehow obliterate the entire GOP tomorrow 90% of non-Americans would be popping champagne (I myself am a pacifist, though).

            "selftext": "The point is fairly simple. I see the media as portraying this as a terrorist attack, and many people (Such as Trump and his supporters) railing on Obama and other Democrats for not calling this Islamic Terrorism. \n\nBut let me flip the discussion and argue the fact that the \"terrorism\" argument is just now being made is disingenuous and fueled by racism. \n\nNow, shortly after the Pulse shooting, there was another shooting that didn't get as much media attention, at least in the U.S. A Radical Nationalist in Britain assassinated a major official because of her anti-Brexit views. This is textbook terrorism, using violence and fear to push an agenda. Yet there's a stark different in googling \"Brexit terrorist\" and \"Orlando terrorist\", as in nothing about the assassination comes up on the first yet there is all kinds of info on the latter. Nobody wants to acknowledge this white man as a terrorist.\n\nBut if we look at the major mass shootings in the U.S in the past few years, we find that almost every single one in recent history was done by a white gunman with no ties to Islam or any terror cells.  Where do we draw the line between \"disturbed mental patient\" and \"terrorist\"? If we need to acknowledge the fact it was towards homosexuals who are a persecuted group in Islam, and therefore view it as a hate crime justified through the lens of a backwards dogma, then that would make the Charleston shooter a year or two back a terrorist by the same principle. \n\nNext argument I anticipate is the fact he pledged allegiance to ISIS after his massacre. This is true, but he had no previous ties to any major terror organization before this, and did it as a way to suppress his own homosexual desires and win favor with any terror cell he could, as he pledged himself to several rival cells. Its clear from testimonies from his family and former loved ones that he was very mentally disturbed from the beginning.\n\nNow, I'm not trying to say he isn't a terrorist, because he absolutely is one. But so is the person who killed that M.P in Britian. And so is the kid who shot up a black church in Charleston. I'm only pointing all of this out because people seem to forget that the vast majority of these sort of shootings are done by white Christians with no ties to any organized terror cell. CMV that this shooting constitutes the usage of the word \"terrorism\" more than the previous ones did. ",

When Hillary announced her candidacy, I was 99.9% sure I was voting Republican. Then, Trump won the nomination. \n\nI also grew up a Christian. I feel that's very important as to why I feel so strongly against both parties this year. Trump says and does things that not only make me sad for America, but scared for America. Torture the families of terrorists? Ban certain reporters because they disagree with him; because, there's not an amendment before the 2nd one apparently. And Hillary, I feel, lied her way to the top. \n\nSo, when I found out Gary Johnson was running, I immediately did some research. I don't agree with him being pro-choice, but no candidate is perfect. \n\nJohnson is already polling at 12%, maybe higher since I last saw a poll. 15% is the threshold to get into the debates. I think by the time the first debate rolls around, he'll heave cleared 15%, and the debates will give him momentum, and exposure needed to win the presidency. Change my view. ",

            "selftext": "preface: This sounds like something that would've been brought up before, but I couldn't find it. Sorry if that is the case. Even if it has been brought up before, I hope I am looking at it in a new light.\n\nContext: I have been debating all my life and a good discussion always brings me joy. I have been really depressed as of recent though with the upcoming election. I am voting for the first time, so i tried to discuss issues with family, friends, and (with rather predictable results) people online. No looking good for the idea of debating. \n\nWhy I think debating may be useless, or even harmful:\n\n1. Information is very limited to all people about most topics. It could be very reasonable for both sides to believe what they do with the very scarce information they have (ex. three conversations = \"all of ___ think ___\"). Debating should help because it introduces each party to these new sources of information, but it in practice usually makes one person a liar. Even worse, a lot of news sources talk about what the other side \"says\". It can be easy for one side to dismiss arguments if they can predict them, even if the arguments are solid.\n\n2. For said reasons above, as I was shocked to find, you can find the perfect living examples of what you think the other side is. Nothing is more draining than going to the other side because they have been framed in such a bad light and seeing them to be even worse. Now is a good time to note that I am *not* talking about Donald Trump or his supporters here (although it can easily be seen in his subreddit if you ever dare look). Him and his supports have created a lot of terrible debating, but he didn't start the trend. \n\nAs a extra point on the end of this idea, it is also hard to debate someone who has ideas either you \"grew out of\" or you have ideas they \"grew out of\".\n\n3. To wrap this up, people very rarely change their minds. Maybe I am just blind to it, but it seems most people just don't change ideas very often. I asked around. When those I asked talked about times they changed their minds, they always made it sound personal. Rarely was it some outside source that helped change their view (ironic saying on this thread). Debating could easily surround the topic with anger and make people defensive. \n\nI would love to have someone change my opinion on this btw. This no joke has put me in a slump for a while now.\n\nedit: ok, I found some past threads debating this. but they are all 1+ years old.",

I was also surprised at the ignorance about the [Bush White House e-mail scandal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bush_White_House_email_controversy), where federal employees were using georgewbush.com, rnchq.org, and gwb43.com e-mail servers for government work. Clinton apparently thought that sending e-mails to people @state.gov would be enough for record keeping compared to everyone being on private e-mail.\n\nThe thing about attacks is that they are routine on the internet - phishing e-mails, port searching, automatic scans for private keys, etc etc etc. None of these constitute a legitimate hack in the sense of  a foreign power stealing information. \n\nI would like to see actual evidence that classified material was taken.\n\n_____\n\n> *Hello, users of CMV!

And the logic is that if group A has criminals in it, that group must then be banned.\n\nObviously though if we apply this logic universally, we need to ban all white christians, black people, asian people.... I think all we'd be left with is maybe buddhists and taoists probably? We'd have less than a million people living in the USA.\n\nI've been waiting to hear Trump explain exactly why it's worse for a Mexican or Muslim to commit a crime over a different race or religion, but he hasn't spoken to this at all.

Many complain of people from other countries coming to 'steal' their jobs. The recent Brexit vote is an example of this, as the 'Leave' campaigners argued that leaving the EU stops the open border policy from being applied to Britain, hence preventing people from less-well-off European countries from moving to Britain and entering it's job market easily. The success of Trump in his arguments to place more surveillance on the Muslims, along with his blatant dislike of the Mexicans, also show that people are generally becoming more intolerant of others.\n\nWith advancements in technology and machine-learning algorithms allowing for more personalised content, people begin to look for communities that share similar views as them, leading to the 'echo chamber' effect where people only subscribe to their own views, and deviant views are labelled as 'trolls' and shot down quickly, only making people more intolerant of other opinions. This is in contrast to traditional media where it served a general public, hence people were exposed to different opinions. \n\nHence I feel the world has become more intolerant today.",

Fill the arena with empty seats. To me, this seems extremely immature. Sure, it may seem funny if you don't like Trump but I know they wouldn't have liked conservatives or Hillary Clinton supporters doing it for a potential Bernie Sanders rally. I don't like Donald Trump and have no interest in voting for him in the general election, but shouldn't as many people as possible be able to see him if they want to? What if there are undecided voters who want to listen to all possible options? Doesn't reserving tickets take away from people who actually want to see what he has to say? What harm does Donald Trump pose by visiting our city? I get that people hate Donald Trump and want to protest the event. But to do so this way seems wrong.

            "selftext": "My reasoning for this is relatively straight forward. One of the main things Trump campaigns on is that he wants to deport all \"illegal\" immigrants (Along with other gross policies, but this is the grossest). This is an aggressive and violent act he wants to commit against millions of people who live here. He wants to send these citizens back to the land they fled from in search of a better life. Therefore, by fighting them, even if from a realpolitik perspective it isn't the smartest action to take, you are defending yourself or your countrymen. \n\nThe average person will then respond \"Well, by entering this country illegally, they committed the first aggressive act, therefore Trump is actually *defending* true Americans, rather than attacking illegal ones. However, why are borders created in the first place? To keep peoples from moving where they want to, to enclose prosperity (or poverty) and to exploit natural resources. There is no natural or physical justification for borders, only convenience and, ultimately, violence. Borders are, always have been, and continue to be upheld by force. Anything that can only justify it's existence by force and violence is unjust, therefore borders are unjust. If I stole your car and then held onto it only because I was stronger than you, is there any period of time that could pass before calling your car mine would be right and just? Borders are the same way. \n\nSo then uprooting millions of people from their homes to send them across an artificial line in the sane is an unjust action, therefore starting the series of aggressive acts with Trump. If somebody is being attacked, it is natural to defend themself from the attack, justifying the defense. \n\nHonestly, I don't know what could change my view here, but I'm still open to other opinions on this. \n\nedit:\n\nHad my view changed by 2 persuasive arguments. First, because in a system as limited as the American one, many Trump supporters might support Trump for many reasons other than wanting to deport Illegal immigrants. As that is, IMO, the only reason violence against him is justified, then attacking his supporters would have a very likely chance of attacking somebody who either doesn't want to deport immigrants or is indifferent, an unjust act. Second, by attacking Trump Supporters, you are more likely hurting the movement as a whole, rather than in an isolated incident. So while maybe this one person would deserve it, you are more likely hurting the very people you're trying to protect more than the bigot in front of you. \n\nedit2: I think I've covered all the original points so far, so I probably won't respond unless it's something creative. \n_____\n\n> *Hello, users of CMV!

            "selftext": "In most recent presidential elections, the third party candidates have only garnered one or two percentage points of the popular vote and no electoral votes. As a result, most people in the United States write off third parties in elections and pollsters often don't include them in their polls.\n\nI believe that *in this election cycle* these polls are inherently inferior to those that include Gary Johnson (and Jill Stein) alongside Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump as candidates because they do not accurately represent the choices that voters will face on election day.\n\nGary Johnson is on track to be on the ballot in all 50 states and in Real Clear Politics' aggregated polling is consistently drawing [eight percent of the vote](http://www.realclearpolitics.com/epolls/2016/president/us/general_election_trump_vs_clinton_vs_johnson_vs_stein-5952.html)\n  from Clinton and Trump, with a further four percent going to Stein. \n\nI'm not one of those people who thinks that Johnson has a chance of winning the election by some crazy hail Mary, but I do think that his candidacy fundamentally alters the electoral landscape, and this needs to be accounted for in order to produce accurate polling information. Nationally, ~10% is a huge chunk of the vote to not go to one of the major parties, and I'm sure in some states the percentage will be higher. Swing states in this election (and possibly even some lean/safe states) will be won and lost in a margin closer than 10%. Hillary Clinton may lose a state or two to Trump she otherwise would have won if Johnson hadn't been in the race or vice versa. \n\nIf pollsters only offer voters two choices, Trump and Hillary, there is no way for their information to be entirely accurate. \n\nNote: the reason I am tentative on the necessity of Stein being included is that she is generally polling at a lower number and to my knowledge is less likely to appear on every ballot. I generally think it would be a good idea for her to be included in every poll, but it is not strictly necessary, especially in states where she is unlikely to appear on the ballot.\n_____\n\n> *Hello, users of CMV!

As long as they don't physically assault you, it is not a crime. People who think \"hate speech\" should be banned are kidding themselves. Yes, that includes forms of cyberbullying, including rape and death threats. How is it that Twitter can tolerate death threats to Donald Trump, but will ban you if you do the same to Anita Sarkeesian? \n\nIf it is something serious, like if you're being doxed or personal information is being released, then you have every right to report and ban them, maybe even take stricter action depending on the level of seriousness. But empty threats are empty. I've seen people protest for stupid things like being against people expressing their views on politics. Right to speech is a fundamental right that should not be monopolized. \n\nWith some people, it's like I'm back in 7th grade : please grow up and realize that sticks and stones will break your bones, but words will never hurt you. Especially on the fucking internet, especially when nobody here knows you personally.\n\nEDIT : I included Twitter as an example of how moderated speech can be masqueraded as free speech. I fully understand it's a corporation that can do whatever it wants. The question is not about Twitter. I'm just saying they're not employing free speech because some people thought hate speech should be banned, and how things are changing like that. I'm not saying Twitter should not be allowed to do that.\n\nEDIT 2 : I believe that persuasion, defamation or hiring hitmen or blackmailing can be charged. I do not think that insulting, taunting or sending threats is culpable, if no one was hurt physically. \n\nEDIT FINAL : Thanks a lot for the points guys. It was really informative. I just wanted to clear up some things. I'm not from the USA. I don't want to say where I'm from, but there are many, many things you can't say here, especially related to political matters. The internet is an amazing place for me therefore. When I heard somewhere that there might be regulations here too, I think I freaked out a little bit. Yeah.

            "selftext": "I've come to this conclusion, even as the causes I believe in have been greatly advanced and empowered by a strong federal government that has consistently overturned what I would consider \"backward\" laws passed by state governments, including, but not limited to gerrymandering districts, gay rights, affirmative action, election practices, etc., etc. Now, you may rightly ask, why do I want states to have MORE power, when they appear (in my opinion) to so consistently abuse that power.\n\nHere are a few basic reasons I've recently changed my mind about this:\n\n1) The rise of uber-nationalist, what I would consider xenophobic politics seems to me to be a result of a vast portion of the body politic which feels disenfranchised or believes that the government at the federal level will never reflect their values. To me, this explains both the Trump phenomenon and the Brexit vote in the U.K. When a large segment of voters feels like there is no possible way the status quo will ever address their needs, they turn to radical ideologies and charismatic  (although, personally, I'm not sure why anyone finds Trump charismatic) leaders. Now, in my mind, federal intervention has done a lot of good for the U.S., particularly in regard to economics. When there is a massive downturn in the economy, the federal government is often the only entity with resources to combat a crisis; so, allow me to soften my position a bit in this regard, when I advocate for states to have more rights, it is mainly in regard to social issues. Now, according to my personal politics, the federal government has done wonderful things to advance social issues. We wouldn't have integrated schools or gay marriage or abortion rights without Supreme Court cases; however, that very power in regard to the federal government can also be turned to dangerous ends. For instance, the Executive branch now has the power to wage war without the consent of Congress. The president can launch nuclear weapons without the consent of Congress. The NSA and CIA can spy on citizens across borders, etc., etc. I simply think that the power to do good with federal mandates becomes that much more dangerous when put in the hands of a person like Donald Trump. I'd rather that the country advance more slowly on social issues, permit people to live closer to their beliefs, rather than foment hatred and the election of someone like Trump.\n\n2) If you don't like the laws of your state, there is at minimum the option to move to a different state, and while, not ideal for the poorer among us, at least those states with bad ideas would show the rest of the country what about their ideology doesn't work.\n\n3) We live in increasingly fractious political times with deep, seemingly irreconcilable beliefs. Perhaps, if we allowed each other more freedom to govern at the local level, there would be less animosity at the national level.\n\nI've recently changed my own mind about this and would be interested to know your thoughts.

            "selftext": "Hello Reddit! I'm here today to tell you about my experience in America. As a black man I've been exposed to a plethora of racial discussion through the years and I have come to the conclusion that diversity has done nothing to improve the country. \n\nDisclaimer: I'll start by saying that I think every race is equal and capibale of equal greatness if they set their mind to it and if they unite as one nation the sky is the limit.\nOver the past hundreds of years racial tension has always existed here and the recent few years have only further exposed this. The current climate today is HEAVILY contentious and is quickly turning into a highly regressive system; anybody who has a different viewpoint to their neighbor is called any number of terms such as \"coon\", \"cracker\",\"straight white man\" and all that meaningless bunkum. I've even seen my own people attempt to close the conversation by asserting that simply people who are white or simply non-black are unable to talk about the issue nor able to take part in non-native culture(also known as \"Cultural appropriation\"). Race has left America so balkanized that we are beginning to focus on attacking each other ignoring issues within our own communities(61 people we're shot in my hometown Chicago last holiday weekend and NO ONE seems to care) and keeping POLITICIANS in line(The top candidates are Trump and Clinton, something is wrong). When a people are divided they are weakened and are therefore unable to address issues to full capabilities. If ALL of the life loving americans, regardless of race would simply come together and solve issues together we would be a MUCH stronger society. I''m tired of the racial tension here but until the culture of America changes it will remain a divided country and in my eyes a divided country is a breaking country.\n\nWe either hang together or simply hang.\n\nP.S sorry for the broken language.\n_____\n\n> *Hello, users of CMV!

            "selftext": "I'm generally a progressive voter and vote Democratic.  Obama received my votes in past two presidential elections.\n\nColbert, Fallon, Daily Show, Wilmore, Conan, etc.  For the past year I've recorded and watched all of their opening monologues. I read CNN and USAToday among others for news.  The unifying theme of the monologues and commentary when the focus is on Trump is to describe an incompetent or a racist or an incompetent racist.  \n\nA recent example from last week is the focus on Trump's seemingly antisemitic use of the star of David in an anti-Clinton tweet.  The joke is fair game, I see the resemblance in the star.  However at the same time the Trump-star made news, the FBI recommended that Clinton's security clearance be revoked.  The monologues and headlines gave mention to this, but the consensus  is that Clinton is a viable candidate.  \n\nOn the Clinton side, the US government is recommending that a presidential candidate's security clearance be revoked.  On the Trump side, one of his aids posted a seemingly antisemitic tweet.  The spin on Trump was that he is a racist, which is a hugely negative impactful statement especially in light of the recent police brutality.  The spin on Clinton is that she made an error, which is a severe understatement in light of the US Government literally labeling Clinton as someone not to be trusted with Government secrets.\n\nThe above example is enough for Media to lose a sense of legitimacy.  One candidate's mishap is aggrandized at the expense of his candidacy's viability, while the other candidate's overt transgressions receive cursory mention.  My explanation of this dichotomy is the large level of financial backing the networks receive from the companies that back the Clinton campaign.  \n\n\n_____\n\n> *Hello, users of CMV!

I'm a socialist, and I'm SO happy that he's brought more progressive ideals into the spotlight. I truly wish that he'd won - but he didn't.\n\nMany die-hard Sanders supporters, including many of my friends on Facebook (the reason I want my view changed - I don't want to lose their friendship) will vote Green or abstain from voting because they think Clinton is extremely corrupt. Of course corruption is bad. But the vague idea of corruption is not going to influence my day to day life. We are going to be influenced by the policies that these people make. I'd love Bernie Sanders to come in and force through universal health care and tuition-free college for everyone. But Bernie Sanders does not have a way to win this election. So, now we're at the crossroads between two ideals: those of Clinton, and those of Trump.\n\nClinton has agreed on a $15 minimum wage, LGBT rights, and less expensive schooling. Just like Bernie. Our alternative is a person who has talked about abolishing the minimum wage because it detriments the rich. Someone who thinks climate change is a hoax propagated by China. Someone who talks about women alternatively as though they're either slabs of fuck-meat or snakes waiting to bite.\n\nI wish that Bernie Sanders were going to compete against Donald Trump, and that I could sensibly vote for him in November. But he won't, and I can't. So currently, my thought is that I should instead use my vote to carry on his ideals. Use my vote to say that YES, I think that LGBT people matter. YES, my future is going to be directly impacted by climate change. YES, everyone deserves a good education, and the US is lagging behind every other first-world country in that department.\n\nI think I should be supporting Clinton - not because I'm some big Hillary fan, but because she is the best vehicle to see Sanders' movement succeed.\n_____\n\n> *Hello, users of CMV!

            "selftext": "Now that Hillary Clinton is definitely going to be a Democratic nominee, the best reason to vote for her that I heard is that she is not Donald Trump.\n\nOften, this argument centers around the next President nominating Supreme Court justices. Of course Trump has a bunch of idiotic policies that generally have no place in civilized society, such as racial profiling, extreme xenophobia, and more.\n\nWhile true, I do thing that the fear of Trump is exaggerated for two reasons.\n\nFirst, we do have confirmation for Supreme Court nominees, and if Trump nominates a judge from Idiocracy, Democrats still have sufficient numbers in Senate to filibuster the nominees. Trump has no popular support, so 2/3 of the country would cheer if they did it for the duration of the presidency.\n\nIncidentally, the same is true for Hillary. If she nominates someone who Republicans don't like, since she is so unpopular, Republicans could also filibuster her nominee for the duration of her presidency, and 2/3 of the country will cheer them on.\n\nSecondly, in terms of Trump idiotic policies, we don't really know what he expects to deliver. Obviously, he is playing to the stupidest, but does he seriously plan to build a wall, much less having Mexicans to pay for it? I seriously doubt it.\n\nAgain, given the fact that he has no base, he is extremely unpopular, there is probably a huge difference between what he claims, and what he could possibly hope to achieve.\n\nMost certainly, he is going to be a one term president, who will probably force a lot of soul searching inside the Republican party. Is this really so much worse that Hillary's candidacy - who actually does have base behind her, will probably last for two terms, and will continue the steady drift of Democrats to the right? I don't know.\n\nCMV, please!\n\n\n_____\n\n> *Hello, users of CMV! This is a footnote from your moderators. We'd just like to remind you of a couple of things.

You have to guard it to do anything and if you are guarding it, the wall wouldn't be much better than a fence.

Experts have reviewed his tax plan and expect the deficit to rise significantly if he gets what he wants.  \n\nHillary has better policies and would move our country in a better direction, but she will clearly say anything to get elected.  She has been involved in far too many scandals.  She is corrupt and too many people don't trust her.\n\nJohnson on the other hand is a libertarian.  Libertarianism is like a compromise for democrats and republicans.  They are fiscally conservative so taxes would likely be lowered, but socially they lean more to the left.  He supports legalization of marijuana, doesn't want to do anything to prevent gay marriage, and basically in general wants to just let people do what they want as long as it doesn't hurt anyone else.

Yet some people persist in claiming that institutional racism is gone. So I thought I would compile some evidence.\n\n\n\n# Economics\n\n## Wealth/housing\n\nOne area where we can see this is with wealth. The median black family has [*twenty times*](http://www.pewsocialtrends.org/2011/07/26/wealth-gaps-rise-to-record-highs-between-whites-blacks-hispanics/) less wealth than the average white family. Much of this disparity is the result of institutionalized housing discrimination, called \"redlining.\" 2011 [research](http://iasp.brandeis.edu/pdfs/Author/shapiro-thomas-m/racialwealthgapbrief.pdf) from Brandeis university found that:\n\n> The number of years families owned their homes was the largest predictor of the gap in wealth growth by race (Figure 2). Residential segregation by government design has a long legacy in this country and underpins many of the challenges African-American families face in buying homes and increasing equity. There are several reasons why home equity rises so much more for whites than African-Americans:\n\n> * Because residential segregation artificially lowers demand, placing a forced ceiling on home equity for AfricanAmericans\nwho own homes in non-white neighborhoods6\n;\n\n>* Because whites are far more able to give inheritances or family assistance for down payments due to historical\nwealth accumulation, white families buy homes and start acquiring equity an average eight years earlier than black\nfamilies7\n;\n\n> * Because whites are far more able to give family financial assistance, larger up-front payments by white homeowners\nlower interest rates and lending costs; and\n> * Due to historic differences in access to credit, typically lower incomes, and factors such as residential segregation,\nthe homeownership rate for white families is 28.4 percent higher than the homeownership rate for black families\n\nThis discrimination is a product of government policy. Boston University historian David Lyons [explains](http://lawdigitalcommons.bc.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1113&context=twlj) that: \n\n> In fact, federal policies promoted racial segregation. Consider\nhousing.

I don't hate them, I'm not afraid of them, but I have no desire to ever own one, mainly because they are loud, they shed everywhere, and they smell bad. I'm also allergic. \n\nMy boss has two dogs that are present in our office almost every day. We don't frequently have visitors here in person, but all of the employees here (usually 3-5 of us) spend a good portion of the day on the phone with clients. It's just embarrassing to have to stop a conference call because one or both of the dogs noticed a squirrel outside and decided to bark like crazy. Additionally, on the rare occasion that we do have clients, contractors, deliveries, or repair people, the dogs are as likely to bite them as not. All of the employees have been bitten at least once by each dog, and one of the contractors we partner with was bitten hard enough to draw blood and tear his pants. Unsurprisingly, he basically stopped working with us after that, which is quite possibly costing us business. \n\nThe behavior of these specific dogs aside, not everyone is a dog person, and I feel like the rights of non-dog people to enjoy a dog free workplace trump the rights of dog owners to bring their dogs to work. Allowing dogs at work should require unanimous approval by everyone at the office, and in the event that the office is client-facing, dogs should not be permitted at all. \n\n\n> *Hello, users of CMV!

            "selftext": "I'm like most people. I'll be the first one to admit that I don't know everything about both candidates, but I'm trying to learn. And as far as I have read, I have concluded personally that Donald Trump seems the better choice.\n\nI understand that Donald Trump has said many, many outrageous things early on, and I was vocally against him for that. But as the months passed, it doesn't take a genius to figure out that he did all that for attention. There are now probably a million videos on YouTube you can watch that dissects Trump's words, how he appeals to the average citizen, how he gets so much free media attention, and how he is now decelerating his outrageous-ness. Trump is openly anti-establishment, and no billionaire or big corporate owner wants him as president. He speaks frankly about issues, and while it has been very reckless in the beginning, it's becoming proper as we near the general election. And he's clearly a successful businessman worth $4.5 billion dollars. You'd be a fool to underestimate him. I see so many millennials and teenagers thinking Trump is some dumb guy who's got no idea what he's doing after watching something like John Oliver's or Stephen Colbert's late night shows. The amount of bias in the media is obvious, they try to point out every small mistake, take things out of context, and treat jokes like actual statements. Some people are seriously saying he's Hitler reincarnate, without realizing how offensive it is to the actual victims of the holocaust. These are the same people who want safe spaces, trigger warnings, and advocate political correctness in comedy.\n\nMeanwhile, the only thing Hillary Clinton has been consistent in is her consistent change of policy, changing with time and audience. She's supposed to be the experienced, intelligent, reasonable candidate amongst the populist, radical others. Someone who has made serious decisions before and has the composure to do so. But as far as I've seen, the biggest point she's trying to sell is that she's a woman. You're right to think that this has been pointed out too many times, but she somehow manages to squeeze that message in all the time. She was undergoing an FBI investigation during this race, for being extremely careless with sensitive information. She lied so, so many times about her emails, whom she sent it to, what were the contents, how classified they were, whether she submitted all the emails, how many were work related, nearly everything, with a straight face. And yet, she's been released of all criminal charges, and no one seems to care about it. Do you really want someone like that as the president? She's switched her position about everything so many times, and maintains at the same time that her record about all that has been very consistent. What? It's like you should sit her down and make her watch everything she's said before.\n\nLook, I don't agree with Trump on many things, but it seems to me like Hillary Clinton is a cold-blooded liar who will do everything in her power to become the president. I think she would do much more crazy shit with that power than Trump can ever dream of, and get away with it as well. But so, so many people think Hillary is the better alternative, the better of two evils, if you will. Please explain to me why.\n\n_____\n\n> *Hello, users of CMV!

            "selftext": "I have been semi keeping pace this election cycle and again the two candidates are picking the lesser of two evils. However my political beliefs disagree more heavily towards Donald Trump. I would prefer this not to be a political belief discussion and who I should vote for, more on the democratic election process and my thought process towards that. My hope this election is that the third party turn out will be significant enough to show that it is possible for them to have a legitimate following, contrary to it only being the typical two parties dueling it out. If I did not live in Florida, my vote would be clear because most other states have voted the same party the last 100 years. However, if I decide to follow through, though improbable, this scenario could realistically happen: Donald Trump wins Florida by one vote, he wins Florida, and this wins him the presidency. This is why I believe a Third Party vote in a swing state is a wasted vote. Change my view. Please.\n\n_____\n\n> *Hello, users of CMV! This is a footnote from your moderators.

            "selftext": "I realize that I'm very late with this news story, but a while back during the whole Judge Curiel affair, Chris Christie came to the aid of Trump and declared that he knows the man is not racist. \n\nTo be clear, I'm not debating the existence of racism in this situation, or whether or not Trump is racist in general. What I am saying is that Christie has no way of knowing whether or not Trump is racist, as he has had no occasion to be discriminated against by him. \n\nSimilarly, for any given recent newsworthy event that involves race, I believe that people who quickly declare that race was not a factor (especially when they themselves were not involved) are misguided. There's no way for me, a white news viewer, to know that for any given police shooting, race was or was not a factor. And if we are to believe that racism is a thing that exists and should be minimized, it's better to be open to the possibility that racism played a part. \n\nWhite people have little occasion to notice racism, as it isn't something that happens to or in front of many of them on a daily basis. Trevor Noah had a bit on his show recently where he compared it to street harassment of women: men don't experience it themselves and rarely see it, so many men were shocked to see a video of a woman being constantly harassed on the street. So (through no fault of their own, necessarily) white people may be predisposed to believe there is less racism in the world than there actually is. Minorities experience racism much more directly, and therefore would be predisposed to see racism more accurately. So essentially, my argument is that it would be better to be open to the possibility of racism, and to believe minorities with direct experience when they describe certain things as racist. They're simply in a better position to know. \n\n\n> *Hello, users of CMV! This is a footnote from your moderators. We'd just like to remind you of a couple of things.

            "selftext": "I've had this nagging feeling in the back of my head for a very long time that Donald Trump isn't actually seriously running for President, but is actually trolling the world. I don't mean \"trolling\" as it has come to be defined in mainstream discourse - i.e. saying something mean is trolling. I mean the classical sense of the word, where you say things you don't necessarily mean for the purpose of getting a particular reaction out of people, and try to push it as far as you can before they realize you are bullshitting. \n\nMy reason for this is because he says and does the exact kind of stuff that I would say and do if I wanted to troll the US/world. Everything he says is just outrageous enough to provoke reactions, but not so outrageous as to be unbelievable. He stands by what he says just long enough for the reaction to build up, before retracting his statement or moving on to something else. \n\nWhat has really pushed me further in this direction is what happened last night at the convention. Everybody is talking about how his wife's speech plagiarized Michelle Obama. That's potential evidence by itself, but the thing fewer people are talking about is the fact that she literally Rickrolled the convention. She said, \"We're never going to give up. And most important of all, we're never going to let you down.\" I mean come on.\n\nTo be fair, I do think it is more likely than not that his campaign is serious. But I think the likelihood that it's the greatest troll in the history of mankind is not insubstantial.\n\nTo change my view, I'd need to see convincing evidence of something he's said or done to indicate that his campaign is completely serious, and that such statement or action couldn't reasonably be interpreted as part of the trolling.\n\nAlternately, my view will be changed if he wins the election, serves out his term in a serious fashion (whatever that means for him) and never admits it was all trolling.\n\nEdit: Thanks for a very interesting discussion everybody. I'd say that my view has been changed and that, while I believe the odds he is trolling are greater than 0, they're small enough that I would call them insubstantial. I've awarded a few deltas and will try to go through and give out more where warranted later tonight.\n\nNote: there was some grumbling about my phrasing in the thread title. I purposely chose non-insubstantial instead of substantial because I believe substantial implies a much larger likelihood than I believed when making the post. Sorry for the confusion.",

            "selftext": "I did search through past topics in this sub, assuming this would have been covered. To my surprise, the most recent that I found was nearly two years ago.\n\n\nI'm not a huge Hillary fan; I supported Bernie in the primaries, I think Hillary is an especially hollow politican-- relying almost entirely on uncontroversial stances, backing from wall street, superpacs, etc. and is very clearly desperate in her attempts to appeal to younger voters. A Hillary presidency doesn't get me particularly excited.\n\n\nHOWEVER. Hillary, in terms of qualifications at least, is a very strong presidential candidate. She served as the first lady for 8 years, the secretary of state for 4, and as a NY senator for 4 years. She is a fairly moderate liberal who is a skilled diplomat and seems as ready as any candidate for the tasks the office requires.\n\n\nIn my opinion, (I will admit, marginally uninformed, but significantly more than many of the people that I've heard using these scandals as evidence against her), both the Benghazi scandal and email scandal are way overblown. I could get into why I think so, but, to be honest, I'm sure some more slightly informed people will outline it below.\n\n\nI don't think Trump is Hitler, or anything close, but the comparison does bear consideration in terms of bigotry, taking advantage of fear, etc. People defend his actions at a totally different standard than the average person. There is clearly still hate in this country, and based on so much of what Trump has said, he is quite misogynistic and racist. I would feel incredibly uncomfortable with someone like this running our country in 2016.\n\n\nSpeaking of misogyny, I think voting someone into office for being a woman is just as deplorable for voting someone in just for being a man. That being said, I've spoken to *many* people, (young people in Massachusetts, one of the most liberal states in the country) that genuinely dislike Hillary just for being a woman. Even those who don't consciously feel this way are often subconsciously motivated by it; being a woman fighting for power with men, she is often portrayed as 'catty' or 'bitchy.'\n\n\nOnce again, I don't think Hillary would be a particularly exceptional president, but I don't think she'd be particularly poor either. Certainly she would be better than Trump, who, in my opinion at least, has the potential to be the worst president the US has ever seen. In years past, (back when Trump was a joke), she was considered a perfectly viable option, one of the most qualified for the job. What exactly makes people think that Hillary would not do a serviceable job? (not meant to sound aggressive, genuinely wondering) And even if you think she'd be subpar, what in the world puts her on the same level as Trump?\n\nUpdate: It's 3:06 AM where I am right now, so I'm gonna hit the hay. As of right now, I've responded to every comment (view not yet changed. I promise I'm not soapboxing; this is simply a firmly held belief of mine, that many people don't seem to agree with. I would genuinely like to understand their rationales, and am willing to change my opinion if provided with a strong enough argument.) I'll pick it back up tomorrow morning, assuming I have more comments to reply to.\n\nUpdate #2: My apologies, guys, I've seen several people point out that calling him \"Drumpf\" makes it difficult to take me seriously. I can understand this opinion, I generally tune people out when they say \"Obummer\" or \"Shillary.\" I downloaded the \"Drumpfinator\" chrome extension several months ago just for fun-- it change the word \"Trump\" to \"Drumpf\" on chrome pages automatically. I didn't realize it would apply to comments that I wrote. I turned it off now, and I'll try to edit when I can, but there'll still be quite a few out there. That one's on me.\n\n\n\nUpdate #3: Wow. Overwhelming number of responses here-- thoroughly enjoyed the discussion. I did award a delta, albeit to u/LtPowers for changing my opinion on the morality of voting for a female because they are a female. At this point, I will only be replying sporadically, since there are at present 376 comments, updating every few minutes, and I do have a life. Thanks everyone!\n_____\n\n> *Hello, users of CMV!

Or how he just wants the [title and none of the responsiblities\n](http://www.slate.com/blogs/the_slatest/2016/07/20/trump_reportedly_wanted_kasich_as_vp_to_be_in_charge_of_domestic_and_foreign.html) and that his VP will do most of the governing.\n\nI think this line of thinking is asinine. He wouldn't be running as hard as he is and campaigning the way he is if he didn't want to win, and the idea that he would just push off work to the office of the VP shows a complete lack of understanding of how the office of the VP and President work.\n\nIt seems like a naive way to cope with the fact that he may win by people who don't want to admit he has a chance of being President.                                                                                                                                                                   \n\n> *Hello, users of CMV!

These alt-right Republicans overwhelmingly seem to support Trump, despite some inconsistent policy proposals the two sides have made an effort to make known. \n\nTo summarize a few of his positions on free speech I recommend reading this article I found by [The National Review] (http://www.nationalreview.com/article/432848/donald-trump-opposes-free-speech-pc-left) \n\nTL;DR and further information: \n\n- Donald Trump is against net Neutrality; citing that it is exactly like the Fairness doctrine, a bill that gave equal airtime to opposing views. \n\n- Believes Edward Snowden should be imprisoned and (potentially?) executed. \n\n- Wants to enact libel law reform to prevent reporters from writing critical \"hit pieces\" against him/his positions. \n\n- Has mentioned silencing the beliefs of muslims by prohibiting them from entering the country based solely upon the religion they choose to practice. \n\nForewarning, I am not a fan of Donald Trump, although I *sympathize* with many of the complaints the alt-right has been championing over the years. However I can't help but notice some double-standards or cognitive dissonance in place. Furthermore, I see a fundamental difference of these two groups of people. I argue that the alt-right focuses primarily on free speech and therefore advocating for a Trump presidency flies right in the face of their ideology. \n\nIf this is relevant at all, I am a social libertarian. \n\nChange my view please, I look forward to a discussion!",

            "selftext": "I'm a huge fan of democracy. I was so incredibly excited when I got old enough to vote, and have faithfully participated at every opportunity since then (I'm in my 30s now). I was always the kind of person who thought if you didn't vote, you had no right to complain, and to make change we had to get together as citizens and put the right people in office. In all aspects of my life I tend to form strong opinions and believe in standing up for them.\n\nWhen Bush beat Gore in very dodgy circumstances, I knew the system was corrupt - but I still believed in voting, to try to make it better. When he won again, I felt disillusionment creeping in, but I told myself I should accept the majority vote even if it seemed misguided to me. I was heartened by candidate Obama, and deeply let down by President Obama - but I rationalized it by saying he was trying his best in a broken system.\n\nNow politics in the US seems so deeply corrupt. It's so obvious that's it's all controlled by moneyed interests, dominated by lies and propaganda, and is a total farce in terms of a true democracy. Maybe I am just getting older, but it honestly seems to have reached another level of awful.\n\nThe Democratic primary showed that the whole game is an insider's club, with no opportunity for the will of people to be expressed. I just read in the news that Clinton has picked a guy who is anti-abortion and pro free trade agreements as her running mate. I consider myself a leftist progressive, and I feel that the candidates put forward by the Democrats are so far away from my beliefs and values that I cannot support them.\n\nAnd that's not even getting into the fact that the Republicans have picked Trump. I can't bring myself to even listen to his acceptance speech (based on comments people have made about it) - it would just depress me and there's nothing I can do about it anyway. \n\nIn my opinion, Clinton is a better choice than Trump, but she's so incredibly distasteful to me, and got the nomination through so much dishonesty that I am very tempted to not even even care anymore. She represents everything I think is broken about the political system and I can't vote for her, even against a dangerous candidate like Trump.\n\nDemocracy is about accepting that you don't always get what you want, and that sometimes the majority wants to go against your preferences. But in this case, I don't feel like the results will in any way be a fair representation of what the American people actually want for their country, no matter who wins.\n\nThe idea of disengaging from politics and not voting is really depressing and disempowering for me. I hope someone can change my view.\n\n*Note: I know that many think voting in local elections does make a real difference, and I am open to that idea, but this CMV is specifically about voting in the presidential election in 2016.*",

So it seems to me that is an intellectual shallowness to complain daily about how \"rigged\" this system is - is  (as if one of the participants would be somehow better and closer to Real reality and we could know which one). If we claim to \"care for our country\" than it should imply we do not despise the opposite views holders - we need both (even extremist) views.../And yes, two-prty does not mean only two parties - each big party has two subgroups, one less extreme as the other./ Two party system is natural - there were always Third Party CAndidates but for these above enumerated reasons they cannot really destroy the basic binary split, because it is ingrained and psychological and necessery. Even in tyrannical oppressive One-Party States (or in oligarchic ones where some small pseudoparties still exist but the system is really rigged) the inner circles have this split - hierarchical authoritarian solutions are in a constant struggle with egalitarian laissez-faire attitudes...Any of the two wins the other side has ways to have a say - in demonstrations or other public forms  and they balance each other always. We cannot simply decide to do \"the right thing\". We always have two different sets of value and wordings - and in most cases there is some compromise worked out (checks and balances are implemented in the institutions for this reason.) I think it is a pity that so few people are able to express their respect for both candidates : both Trump and Clinton do a terrific job of representing their patrons (millions in both case) worldview (and yes minority group representative Bernie was also doing a great job, thanks).

            "selftext": "Trump and many other demagogues have been arguing that China and other countries have been taking our jobs, leaving us with nothing. I beg to differ. \n\nI say that let the market economics do their job. There is little need to keep some parts of the industry here if some other guy can do it cheaper on the other side of the globe. Business must be profitable. The poor nations and emerging economics need investments and productive industry, because economical factors are the most significant when it comes to reducing global population growth. Making the middle class starts from building investments and required infrastructure. So we win. We gain cheaper products, they gain jobs and some prosperity. \n\nI use my own country Finland as an example. Before the financial crisis of 2008 we had extremely good forest industry and Nokia. Then the hammer hit us hard and many factories had to closed. Nokia suffered the same fate. These cuts hit the smaller communities hard. The said communities where centered around the factory. This is the reason why I argue it's better for us to change. Finland had trusted the basic industry and the moment things went to hell, we were dragged to bottom with it. It was not sustainable economic model in more competitive global economics. There were sings about the decreasing competitiveness early on but as my nations poor economic development and 8-year long recession has proven, change is nigh impossible. Especially for a nation where factories created the welfare.  \n\nHence why the West needs more specialized industry. Not making steel but making supercomputers, quality airplanes and hi-tech products that need specialized skills and labor. This requires lot from the employees but the world has indeed changed. Today we compete globally and the only way to remain in the game is to acquire new skills, learn new trades and increase productivity. This is only possible if we comprehend the fact that low-skills jobs are not the future, especially in the industry. Trump and others like him are just dragging us down. \n\nMy argument is that we should specialize more and create new fields, leading to new kinds of manufacturing, not to yearn for the past and low-skills industry jobs. If anything we should discard the ideas to bring back old type \"smoke chimney\"-factories. What we need is more factories run by computers and engineers are rank and file employees. \n\n_____\n\n> *Hello, users of CMV! This is a footnote from your moderators.

            "selftext": "I feel as the US election draws closer to November and the main party candidates are all but selected (as of next, they will be), a major arguing point among the Democratic electorate is that Hilary Clinton represents \"the lesser of two evils\". Those who are familiar with her political history know that she's gotten her hands dirty on more than one occasion, and as a result many people aren't comfortable voting for her, but are being persuaded to reconsider, because \"do you really want Donald Trump to be president?\"\n\nI disagree with this line of thinking, because the \"lesser of two evils\" vote only perpetuates the system whereby disenfranchised Democrats end up voting for candidates they really don't like that much, in order to keep candidates they really don't like out of office. The Democratic party can therefore keep running mediocre or right-leaning candidates under the Democratic label, and rely on the voter base to vote for them if they're less nutty than the Republican candidate. In this election cycle, Hilary is not the greatest choice for president, but many would agree that at least she's not Trump.\n\nWhat I think Democrats who don't like either Hilary or Trump should do is vote for a third party candidate. Of course, the risk of doing this is that if the left-leaning vote is split between two or three presidential candidates, then there is an increased chance that Trump will win the election. However, I think that this is a fair cost for the Democratic party to realize that they need to have a political platform that caters to voters not just as a foil to the Republican platform, but as a good political platform in itself. Especially after the recent DNC email leak, the Democrats need to learn the lesson that if you don't create the progressive platform that left-leaning Americans want, they will go somewhere else. CMV!\n\n-----\n\n**EDIT 1: On the argument that \"Nothing changed after Nader/Gore/Bush in 2000**\n\nSee my response [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/4udyh3/cmv_democratsvoters_who_dont_like_hilary_clinton/d5p4gmi). I argue that the 2000 election isn't comparable to this one either in terms of candidates or political/economic situation. It still remains possible therefore that a loss in this election could cause a shift to the left in the Democratic party, *especially* if they lose against the absurdity of Trump.\n_____\n\n> *Hello, users of CMV!

They actively engaged to suppress the expression of millions of American voters who have a right to self determite for whom they cast a vote. Not only that, they intentionally strove to cast those same Americans, who happen to be members of their own party, in a negative light.\n\nThe theme of the DNC seems to be unity, and yet we have blatant evidence that the command structure of the dnc had no intentions of listening, honoring, or respecting the wishes of nearly half of their own base. Not to mention what a shitshow the super delegates thing is. You mean to tell me our candidate was picked for us before I had a chance to hear at least one reasoned debate between a few select personalities and ideologies?\n\nAnyways it seems that he's going through with his endorsement of Hillary Clinton. Now as someone who is rather apolotical, I always kind of liked bernie, for the same reason the vast majority of my age group did. If he does go through with his endorsement, I can firmly say he will lose all of my support forever and always. It's simple. We have blatant evidence that everything he fought to change is happening. His support for Hillary is support for a corrupt system that actively disenfranchised him.\n\nNow I understand that he's worried Trump might take office. Frankly in the wake of these revelations that actuality is appearing more likely than ever, and with good reason. The establishment has been force feeding us Hillary through some mistaken sense that it's \"her turn\" as though the presidency were some kindergarten drinking fountain, and haven't allowed their base the basic right to elect their own leaders. \n\nSee the biggest difference between Trump and Clinton is ridiculously simple. Trump is a populist candidate who the people have supported against the wishes of the establishment, and Hillary is a candidate who the establishment are supporting against the wishes of the people. \n\nPersonally I'll never support Hillary or what she stands for. If anything I'm voting 3rd party this election for Gary Johnson at this point, in the hopes that if enough of us split the vote up maybe some room can be created for more parties to exist.\n\nI'll do this at the cost of a Trump presidency because imo it's better than a Clinton presidency. Of the two, at least Trump is honest. I feel he says what he actually believes, even if it is sexist or bigotted. I don't believe I've ever heard Clinton's true beliefs. I think she tries to play the game of thrones, and say what people want to hear, but she can't even feign affability or relatability well. See her attempts to dab, or talk about pokemon go.\n\nPersonally I think bernie should go third party for the hell of it. Because at this point he's got nothing left to lose. I'll never vote Democrat because frankly I find all this appalling. If Bernie continues to support them then he believes differently, and as such he loses credibility as just another cog in the system.",

As much as Clinton allegedly (and likely) played dirty to get elected, can we just bite the bullet here so we don't risk actually getting Donald Trump to be the 45th president? Understand why you support Sanders, understand that the likelihood of an overhaul of the system happening in the next few months is so unlikely that it does not warrant the risk that the destabilization exposes the country to (TRUMP). If you're a Trump supporter I understand how you can advocate for Clinton getting in trouble, but so many of the people who are upset at DWS are ex-Bernie supporters. I concede, you're correct, it's fucked, can we just move on because if we compared our fucked to their fucked, they're more fucked.\n\n",

            "selftext": "When I registered to vote at 18, I registered as a democrat without being fully aware of what the party platform was, and its recent history. I knew I agreed with democrats more than republicans, and decided I was a democrat. I'm 24 now, and have learned a lot since then. I have also realized since then that I am very far left of the Democratic party.\n\nDemocracy should be about having a voice for your opinions, and having a two party system keeps many people voting for what they would consider the lesser of two evils instead of voting for someone they actually agree with. I'm far left of the Democratic party, and think Hillary Clinton is doing a lot of things I find morally wrong. I have read through her website multiple times, and disagree with a lot of what she wants to do and why she wants to do it.\n\nDonald Trump seems like he would be a horrible president, and is way too vague when it comes to what he wants to do. Even with the vagueness, I strongly disagree with his plans if he becomes the president. \n\nDemocracy in the US has been a two party system for almost its entire history, and I think that's horrible. I'm far left of both parties and would rather vote my conscious with someone that has a political stance closer to mine. \n\n\nMost people's argument against this is \"but imagine TRUMP as president!!\" Yes, I agree that would not be a good thing, but I also feel that Hillary would not represent me or my beliefs. Although I would consider Hillary Clinton as the lesser of two evils (only by a little), she is still far right of what I would want in my president.\n\n**Edit: Thanks for all of the responses, this is a great community / subreddit. I'm trying my best to get to each comment, but you guys are posting a lot faster than I can read and reply, especially with all of the well thought out and detailed replies. Seriously though, thank you for the great conversations.**\n\nEdit 2: To clarify something, I don't expect any third party candidate to win. Voting third party would just be a vote for someone I believe in, which is part of democracy.\n\nEdit 3: Not too relevant in the overall discussion, but I saw a few comments saying that my views are center right. https://www.politicalcompass.org/yourpoliticalcompass?ec=-5.13&soc=-2.87\n\n**It's 9:40am and I haven't gone to sleep yet, so I'm going to go to bed. I'll read more responses later. Thank you all for the great discussions, even though I wasn't a part of most of them**\n\n#FINAL EDIT: MY VIEW HAS CHANGED \n\nMostly thanks to /u/RogueLeaderJ and /u/tigereyes69, link to comments [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/4uif77/cmv_i_would_rather_vote_for_a_third_party/d5pwm4f), and I highly recommend reading them.

They could temporarily hire her as a \"consultant\" or \"liaison\". But she should not get up on any stage and act like she's the leader of anything.\n\nHer presence will show left-leaning Democrats that their voice is not valued and will simply result in more division and an increased likelihood of Trump getting elected.

            "selftext": "I have changed my mind on Hillary Clinton. I do believe now that Hillary Clinton is a good choice to be the next president. Let me explain my unorthodox reasoning. \n\nI will try to abstain from using the argument that she can be viewed as a lesser evil compared to Donald Trump, which I previously believed. Although I think this is a valid argument, given that many of Trump political stances (immigration, women, national debt, foreign policy) are extremely undesirable, I think more reasonable arguments could be made to view the candidacy of Hillary Clinton from a different perspective. \n\nPeople tend to favor candidates that come across as familiar. In this respect Trump's bigotry towards minorities connects with many voters. Hillary Clinton has a more difficult time connecting with voters, because she does seem to come across as calculated, untrustworthy, only caring about votes and not really passionate about the issues. \n\nThe thing is, presidents are not in the position to enforce their view on policy on Congress. They ask for a mandate from their constituents, but when it comes to implementing their policy views into law, presidents need to find a majority in Congress to support their view. Look at president Obama, Obamacare is very similar to what Romney already enacted in Massachusetts. If Obama would have been more partisan, there would not be an Obamacare. Therefore, one of the essential characteristics of a president is not to be too partisan. This is already very difficult in the current Congress. \n\nIf you look at the record of Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders, you will see that Bernie Sanders has voted very partisan on the issues ( http://www.thelugarcenter.org/ourwork-Bipartisan-Index.html ). Bernie Sanders is one of the most partisan politician in Congress. Make no mistake, I do like Bernie Sanders, but he is more a grassroot leader than a president. Grassroot leaders push issues to politicians, presidents push deals with politicians through Congress and enforce them. Sorry Bernie, Jill and Gary, although I sympathize with many of your ideas, if any of you would become president, you wouldn\u2019t find the support in Congress to enact them. Hillary Clinton\u2019s record is more bipartisan as she has various allies in the Republican party (http://correctrecord.org/praise-for-hillary-clinton/ ). Therefore, she would be a more effective president. \n\nIs she a good politician? Hillary Clinton ran twice for US senator in New York. When she was re-elected as a US senator after 6 years, she won the election 67,00 %, which indicates that the majority of New Yorkers were happy with her work after 6 years. When she was secretary of state, her approval ratings had an all time high (64%) (Today I read about the Hillary doctrine, quite interesting). This rating declined when she had left the position in the wake of criticism over Benghazi and e-mailgate. I think it is fair to say that she is a good politician (otherwise she would not have been nominated as secretary of state nor would she be a US senator twice). \n\nHillary Clinton is running on a moderate agenda, implementing a lighter version of Bernie Sanders\u2019ideas. Although I am not convinced of all her talking points (not a fan of encryption, moderate change to election financing laws), I do believe this is the right direction. If people want more change, they need to push their representative in Congress. Change comes from bottom up, not top down. Look at gay marriage. Politicians only changed their minds because of the changed political climate (funny clip: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik8JT2S-kBE ). The last thing politicians do is upsetting their constituents (Even Bernie Sanders\u2019record was not always straight on gay marriage). \n\nHillary Clinton, like most politicians, also embodies that philosophy. She is running on what she thinks the majority of people in the United States want. It\u2019s not fancy or extremely inspiring, but her policies are on the right track. Trump does not come even close to that. Hillary will be a president that moves the country to the right direction. Do take into account that the legacy of a president, by appointing a Supreme Court justice, can go far beyond the 4-8 years of the presidency.\n\nAdditionally, top politicians are a special breed and as politics is an ugly art, leader often possess that charismatic aura that makes you forget some of their mistakes. Hillary is a politician functioning at the top of US politics, but she lacks that charismatic aura which makes her more vulnerable to attacks like e-mailgate and Benghazi,  which, if you look at them rationally, they have a  80 mud / 20 scandal rate. Hillary made mistakes in the past, but to say she is very fraudulent or very corrupt is overdone. She already had a political career of approximately 35 years. If nothing really sticks in 35 years, it\u2019s probably not ground breaking. \n\nWith regards to the very recent strategic (wiki)leaks. You cannot blame Hillary on the fact that the DNC wasn\u2019t completely impartial. What was she supposed to do? Please, please don\u2019t favor me? The DNC made mistakes, Hillary played her game and she won. Bernie was not seen by the establishment as a potential good president. Politics is ugly. Sorry Bernie. The claim made today that the DNC was promising federal appointments to donors seems at first hand bogus. They were just looking for potential people to put on the nomination list. I am sure this is gonna be spinned, but so far I don\u2019t see the drama yet.  \n\nDo take into account that the hacker only hacked the DNC and not the RNC. He probably has an agenda (in the cyrillic alphabet) to make people not vote or vote for a fringe candidate to increase the chances for Trump. It\u2019s not an improbable spin. Russia is funding extreme right wing parties in Europe (http://imrussia.org/en/analysis/world/2500-putinism-and-the-european-far-right )\n. \nNext, Clinton Foundation and the Goldman Sachs speeches. The Clinton Foundation gets good reviews by objective sources, Republicans have also worked for this foundation. There could be a conflict of interest, but if he would be serious, she wouldn\u2019t have been appointed as secretary of state or things would have gone nuclear much more earlier. \n\nWith regards to Goldman Sachs, it\u2019s not hard to figure out what is in those speeches. She probably sympathizes in those speeches with the banking industry, wanting to work together with them after the election. This is how every president in the past 50 years has treated the banking industry anyway. Too much banking regulation curbs economic growth, lack of regulation gives a big boom at the end. Don\u2019t forget that governments needs banks.  To blame Bill Clinton for the past banking crisis, does not do justice to history. He had a part, just like many others. It\u2019s easy to lay blame on people at hindsight. By the way, Paul Volcker supported the bipartisan deregulation as well.  \n\nPeople think of Hillary as untrustworthy. This was one of the reasons why I was on the fence with her as well. But consider this, when confronted she thinks like a lawyer. She assesses what is known by her adversaries or and complies her story so it fits the narrative that contains the least damage to her. If new information arises, she occasionally has to change her story. This is really how lawyers defend their clients. It doesn\u2019t always work because new information may arise, but in legal proceedings, it is very effective. It\u2019s a survival skill. If she would have an aura around her like fresh politicians, she would have gotten away with it. Top politicians are a rare breed, they try to fit the narrative of being just like you, but they are not. They all share the same Machiavellian survival skills that most of us don\u2019t (want to) have. Those that serve their constituents well, remain at the top. Hillary remained at the top for decades. Not many other politicians can say that.\n\nI think her survivalskills, decent agenda for the future and bipartisan outlook will make her a good president to handle the future Congress, more than Bernie Sanders, Jill Stein, Donald Trump, and Gary Johnson. Her lack of charismatic aura makes her more prone for criticism, but Hillary Clinton is one of the most resilient politicians on the planet. She has received more punches than Rocky in all of the Rocky movies and she is still standing. You gotta give her credit for that. \n_____\n\n> *Hello, users of CMV!

            "selftext": "So many people seem concerned in Democratic Party unity this election, but I'm not convinced that Clinton ever needed to make any concessions to Sanders's supporters. I supported Sanders's general election campaign, but I think we all have an inflated sense of the importance of Sanders's supporters because they tend to be (1) Redditors, so there's an availability bias, (2) loud, and (3) passionate. But that doesn't necessarily matter in terms of overall votes.\n\nEssentially, the number of Sanders's supporters that Clinton could sway by continuing to make concessions to the left are not enough to justify the effort. Sanders's supporters tended to be young people, who do not turn out in large numbers in a general election. People over 30 are more likely to vote, and they tend to be more moderate, so it made perfect sense for Hillary Clinton to pick Tim Kaine, a more moderate vice president, in the hopes of appealing to centrists who are disillusioned with Donald Trump. Clinton would be better served by spending time making her get-out-the-vote case to the groups of people who already support her and dislike the Donald (i.e., women, minorities, and moderate Democrats), and trying to woo moderate Republicans who have been turned off by Trump, than trying to cater to a group of people who are notoriously fickle on election day.\n\nThis is based on my general sense of the importance of these groups to the overall electoral map, but I have never studied political science. Seeing concrete numbers would be more likely to convince me than mere rhetoric.\n\n_____\n\n> *Hello, users of CMV! This is a footnote from your moderators.

At the same time, so few people advance this far into their declarations to hold the highest office, that we're only subjecting people to this intrusion who really ought to agree that we should be subjecting people to this intrusion. So they agree that there's no harm of such a security review when it comes to harm to them personally. But are there generalized arguments against this practice? \n\n**In short:** Why shouldn't an agency like the NSA attempt to characterize the nature of contact and potential for influence between the most serious presidential candidates and known hostile, if not all, foreign governments? \n\n^* N.B., the truth of the Russia/Trump allegations are irrelevant. FWIW, I suspect the substance of them are untrue.

I am not a Hillary Clinton support but rather a Trump hater. So my political beliefs aren't \"blinding me\" as people have been blindly saying to me.\n\n\nOn the Mega thread for the DNC leaked emails and other posts there have been a lot of accusations that people donating were promise positions. I do not see that at all and seems like people are just trying to fabricated evidence to hate Hillary. Here is the link to the article that has been sumbitted to reddit that has caused such a storm.\n\n http://dailycaller.com/2016/07/24/leaked-dnc-documents-show-plans-to-reward-big-donors-with-federal-appointments/ \n\nIn the Article it tries to insinuate that the people on the spreadsheet were promise positions because of their donations to Hillary. There are a lot of problems with that claim. \n\n It tries to hover over the fact that a supervisor asked for a list of people who might be interested in federal positions. No were in any sense does it say there were promise those positions or even asked for those positions. The author's evidence for this is that a women has USPS or U.S postal service next to her name. This woman was literally nominated by Obama but the republican congress block his nomination. So it would make sense to put USPS name to her next because that is obviously what she wants and is qualified for. The notion that she bribed her way into that position is completely fabricated. \n\nThe article then tries to go on and make it seemed that they are just hand picking the largest donors which is just not true and has no evidence.  From what I see from these emails is that someone is asking people within the party to make a list of candidates that has a niche interest in certain boards and would maybe like to be appointed to those boards. They then created a list of their own people, which is done by everyone today, to promote their own. No were does it say that there was promises, that they asked to be given these positions or even that Hillary Clinton was even involved in any of these affairs. I don't think it is even fair to say of this propaganda is real in a sense. It is just fabricated to try to support certain political views.\n\n\n> *Hello, users of CMV!

I find arguing to be fun, so I get into discussions with all kinds of people. I've heard good and bad arguments for almost every political belief in America. Heck, I've heard logical, well-thought out, coherent arguments for eugenics. And yet, I've never heard a Trump supporter give me a single intelligent reason why they are backing him. Nothing. Just idiotic conspiracy theories or resentment or pure stupidity. I want to know if there's someone out there who can defend him. Someone who can answer for everything he's said, and explain why they support him anyway. I don't want to believe that the support for Trump is exactly what it appears to be.\n\nA few caveats:\n\n* Yes, I am aware that Ben Carson is an absolute genius. I won't dispute that, but I'll say that while he may be a very intelligent man, his support for Trump is not. I will not change my view based on circumstantial genius, I want a specific defense of Trump.\n* I want to hear from the real Nimble Navigators, the ones who looked at a field of 17 candidates and chose him. I live in the South, I know plenty of people who hate his guts but will still vote for him in November and then get black-out drunk after. I want to know why people believe in him. If you've called someone a cuck or typed the word \"MAGA!\" within the last week, you're perfect.\n* As I said in my title, if you hate America and want to screw us over and diminish our influence in the world, I see why you would support Trump. That's a perfectly valid and logical line of reasoning, and I've got no problems with it. However, in this CMV, I would like to hear from actual Americans who back Trump, not our enemies. Sorry Putin.\n\nI hereby throw the gauntlet down to /r/the_donald, and challenge them to show up and defend their God-Emperor from the hateful media spin of the rigged system. \n_____\n\n> *Hello, users of CMV!

            "selftext": "It seems at every turn, both the Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump campaigns seem to take the opportunity to shoot themselves in the foot. I think it happens often enough that they're more than mistakes, it's a gross incompetence.\n\nLet's start with the Trump campaign:\n\n- The Trump campaign has let Trump speak off the cuff rather than prepared statements. As Trump isn't an experienced politician, he does not choose his words carefully or think through what he's about to say. This has led to things such as the Curiel \"Mexican\" comments.\n- Trump's long leash extends to his Twitter feed, which he apparently updates himself rather than having a staffer manage it. Trump's quick fingers retweet some questionable things, like the image of Clinton with a Star of David, which originated on a white supremacist board.\n- After the Curiel comments, the campaign let Trump on TV to speak about it again, apparently without notes, where he doubled down on the comments by saying that it would be a problem if Curiel was Muslim, too.\n- The Star of David Tweet was originally explained by the campaign in a way that suggested *they* made it, rather than vetting the source.\n- In response to the Melania Trump speech, they did not vet the speech for similarities to other speeches.\n- In response to the Cruz \"vote your conscience\" booing, Trump ruined the positive campaign coverage by rehashing the National Enquirer story.\n\nNow, the Clinton campaign. While there are fewer, they're larger mistakes:\n\n- In the midst of the email investigation, Bill Clinton met with the head of the ~~FBI~~ Justice Department. This is a very obvious mistake involving the optics of the situation. Considering the opinion from people on both sides of the aisle that Hillary is corrupt, you do *not* make it look anything like you're trying to cut a deal with the prosecutor.\n- The DNC email leak caused Debbie Wasserman Schultz, who attempted to coordinate with the Clinton campaign and dispose of Sanders before the primaries were over, to resign. Within hours, she had a job with the Clinton campaign. This bolsters the image that she is corrupt.\n\n---\nNote: This CMV is about the campaigns, not necessarily about the candidates or who I should vote for.",

He represents the vocal minority of the GOP that people often make strawman arguments against. He's made a mockery of the party repeatedly, and every notable republican has at some point over the past year taken a moment to denounce him (even if they have reluctantly decided to back him now). I believe that this will turn off many current republican voters from the party, and especially new young voters who might otherwise swing republican. He's just too much crazy for most people. Perhaps converting to independent, libertarian, or something new.\n\nHillary has messed up. They tried to rig the election ever so subtly, but there are now too many very blatant examples of the people's voice being ignored. The emails we keep getting confirm this. The money she accepts from companies confirm this. The numerous questionable primary results all over the country confirm this. Meanwhile, she is clearly guilty of a federal crime and, if she were anyone else, would absolutely be in prison right now, or at least tied up in an infinite amount of red tape. And on top of all that, the DNC themselves favored Hillary through this whole thing, and everyone was watching. Democrats will question the DNC big time now. Bernie has the power right now to move many Dems to Independent, Green, or something else.\n\nI don't think the GOP shift will happen if Hillary wins, because they will unite against Hillary. Similarly, if Trump wins, I think Bernie will choose to keep the power of the Democrat party behind him rather than splinter it, in an effort to unite against Trump.\n\nCMV.",

            "selftext": "America (and most other Democratic countries for that matter) would be much better off with a \"ranked choice\" voting system instead of what we have now (single option).\n\nThe more I see in this election cycle, the more I'm infuriated by how easily our candidates get votes by making people fear the opposite party. It almost always leads to situations like the present one, where even after a scandal revealing Hillary's collusion with the DNC, Senator Sanders is still left with no choice but to push his constituents to vote for  in order to save the country from Trump.\n\nIn my opinion, letting voters rank candidates by preference would entirely solve the problem. It would:\n\n1) Give third party candidates a much better chance by eliminating the fear that voting for them is \"throwing your vote away.\"\n\n2) Force candidates to talk policy instead of attacking each other.\n\n3) Reduce the effectiveness of \"wedge issues\" as a tactic for winning votes.\n\nThis should be common practice in all democratic countries IMHO.\n_____\n\n> *Hello, users of CMV!

            "selftext": "My distaste for Trump is probably best summarized in this comment by /u/DetectiveGodvyel , but I have some other things I'll add below this.\n\n\"He's already advocated spreading nuclear weapons to more countries, murdering civilians and committing war crimes, punishing any woman who gets an abortion, toss out the Geneva convention and torture people, withdraw from NATO, and ban an entire religion from the country, and create a database of muslims.\n\nHe said he would deport US citizens and thinks global warming is a hoax created by the chinese, thinks the US should default on its debt, defends the interment of Japanese Americans in WW2.\n\nHe thinks Obama is a muslim and accused him of not being american and accused him of being an ISIS sympathizer, insulted war heros because they got captured, racially insulted a sitting Senator. He bragged about his dick size in a GOP debate and has suggested he might quit if he's actually elected.\n\nHe consistently thinks women are only valuable for how they look, with at least a dozen high-profile misogynistic comments.\n\nHe's called nuking the middle east a plausible option. He has a suspicious number of ties to Putin, and has a history of business deals with organized crime. He's called mexicans rapists and criminals, been successfully sued multiple times for racist rental practices, and said he wants no blacks only jews counting his money.\n\nHe semi-threatened the pope, mocked disabled people in front of a crowd of thousands, outright threatened violence towards the media and protesters, made sexual comments about his daughters MULTIPLE TIMES, praised Kim Jong Un and Putin and Saddam Hussein, praised the Tianenmen Square massacre.\n\nHe's flirted with white supremacy - retweeting them, reposting their images with anti-semitic symbols, playing coy about David Duke's endorsement. He's a verified lunatic conspiracy theorist - he thinks the Clintons murdered one of their aides, Obama is a sleeper agent and Ted Cruz's dad helped kill JFK.\n\nHe could get caught diddling kids and funding ISIS himself and his supporters would eat it up. Either way, Ladies and Gentlemen, your Republican party nominee.\"\n\nI'll be voting in a swing state (I'm going to school at University of Pittsburgh), which means voting third party feels like throwing my vote. I also don't fucks with the Libertarian party, and Jill Stein has a host of anti-nuclear power rhetoric as well and homeopathic pandering that I'm not down with. \nWhat /u/DetectiveGodvyel missed that I find most troubling is the Supreme Court nominations. Even if I truly find claims of corruption and capitalistic interest on Clinton's part true, I'm most worried about there being 3 Mike Pence's in the SC, reversing LGBT rights and liberal humanitarian efforts back decades. \nThis is merely a sidenote, but the /r/S4P rhetoric seems to be coming from people who can afford to flirt with a trump presidency the most. If you are an upper middle class white male shouting Bernie or bust, the presidency actually effects you the least. \nAnyways, cmv.\n\n\n",

            "selftext": "Hi all. So my view is that we are now WAY to connected to one another and it's causing a lot of problems.\n\nSocial Media in general arrived with MySpace. This happened in about 2005, before there were smartphones and tablets. If social media and the internet in general had remained a thing that only ran on a computer, we many not be having this discussion. It  was the arrival of Facebook and the iPhone that changed how we talk to one another. I feel like since these things occurred and we became more and more anonymous on the Internet, we have become worse to one another and have become polarized.\n\nFor example;\n\nI'm from Ontario, Canada. Right now we have likely the WORST government in existence which is run by the Liberal Party. I made the error of mentioning that I am a Liberal online to a bunch of obscure faces. Without letting me explain, they proceeded to call me an enabler of taxing on tax, reckless spending and supporting a Premier that has had dozens of scandals. Yes, I am a Liberal...normally...but I think that this government is so far gone that I would actually vote them out in favour of the Conservatives if I had too. The point is, once I stated that I am a Liberal, nothing else mattered and I no longer could say anything without getting my head chomped off or called a moron.\n\nThis sort of thing has made me sour at humanity in general. I mentioned once online that Black Lives Matter should look at how they function as a people before pinning it all on the white and Hispanic people. I wasn't being racist with that statement one bit. Still, I was told that I was no better than the average Trump supporter for saying it.\n\nI think the connection online and through our phones has polarized us more than ever. We now go on full on witch hunts before anyone has actually given cold hard facts. People get alienated and shamed online for things they didn't do that they then have to live with because if things like this. Politically we are now a mess world wide. We have violence happening in Europe, Trump/Clinton in the US and elsewhere there is more political bullshit than JFK could fit in an Apollo rocket and send to the moon!\n\nI have been more angry in the past few years over people who can't disconnect while driving. Someone has nearly killed me in a car accident because posting on Facebook was more important than paying attention to the stopped car in front of them. And regardless of deterring laws, people STILL do it.\n\nChange my view on the fact that we need to disconnect in order to re calibrate on ourselves as human beings. We are so bored with life because the online connection is what sustains us now. I'm old enough to remember when side walk chalk was the coolest thing to have on the block...and I'm not even in my 30s!\n\nI once believed in the idea of a Singularity. The idea where we would all come together and understand on another. But as time goes on...I feel like that theory will remain just that. We are all too different from one another to ever fully get along. That notion of \"World Peace is Possible\" that I had while I was a kid is gone. It can't happen.\n\nSo I really honestly challenge you to show me why being connected the closely is a good thing at all. Funny...I complain about the opinions of faceless mob...now I'm asking for them...\n\n_____\n\n> *Hello, users of CMV! This is a footnote from your moderators.

            "selftext": "For context, I am an 18 year old Bernie Sanders supporter from NJ who acknowledges that Hillary Clinton is a better & safer candidate than Trump (at least from my perspective). Right now I am eyeballing Jill Stein, assuming she's on the ballot in my state, because she represents my views more than Hillary or Trump.\n\nWhen I tell my Democrat friends my intentions of voting for Jill Stein, they say something along the lines of, \"A vote for Stein is a vote for Trump,\" referencing Nader in 2000.\n\nThe problem I have with this conventional wisdom is that it assumes in a two person race, I would vote for Hillary because she is the Democrat, and I am a leftist. Frankly, neither candidate excites me, both frighten me to an extent, and while Hillary *is* closer, neither truly represents my ideological views. \n\nFor people like me, my argument is that we wouldn't vote at all in a two person race, therefore my theoretical vote for a third party is not hypothetically \"helping\" anyone else.\n\nThe point is, recognizing I'm in NJ which is a safe blue state, why should I not vote for Jill Stein or any other minor party?\n\n(Obviously this logic also works for \"a vote for Johnson is a vote for Hillary\" etc.)\n\n_____\n\n> *Hello, users of CMV!

            "selftext": "This is a CMV about policy. To change my view, you'll have to convince me that Hillary Clinton has major policy differences from Obama, preferably larger than the difference between Obama and Trump on at least some of the issues.\n\nI think Hillary Clinton will be very similar in policy to Obama. The following are not positions I am endorsing, they are just positions I think the two share. If you hate Obama's policy's you'll probably hate Clinton's. If you love Obama's policy's, you'll probably love Clinton's.\n\n* Health care: Seeks to expand the affordable care act, lots of evidence from 90's and past campaigns that this is a major issue for her - but even in the face of Republican obstructionism she would at least be in a position to preserver it.\n* Taxation and Budget: Supports progressive taxation, proposes spending on all current entitlements but also has elements in her platform like expanded funding for attending public universities, expanded. These sorts of initiatives will depend on a helpful congress - without one I think her budget's will look very similar to Obama's.\n* Climate Change: Does not deny the overwhelming scientific consensus. Supports alternative energy. A little hard to say whether she'd do something like Veto Keystone pipeline, but seems broadly consistent with Obama. \n* Foreign policy: Literally was secretary of state, so talk about continuity! Probably more hawkish than Obama. Shares the general philosophy of US as leader/member of international organizations like NATO, UN, etc. and the responsibilities that those come with.\n* Free trade: Broadly consistent with Obama who has generally supported free trade, not started a trade war with china, only recently cracked down on tax inversion mergers, etc, though pushed in a protectionist direction during the primary. Hard to say exactly how TPP will pan out, and whether Hillary's opposition is very adamant - we'll learn more going forward. \n* Guns: Anti-gun rhetoric - however note that obama did not accomplish anything substantial in terms of gun control legislation. This is really in the hand's of congress, courts, and popular sentiment.\n* Immigration: Plans to support path to citizenship, keep up anti-deportation orders. Very pro-immigration and consistent with Obama.\n* Financial regulation: Obama increased the number of SEC prosecutions and congress passed Dodd-Frank. Hillary Clinton will probably work within this framework, making some modifications to Dodd-Frank, but I strongly doubt she will institute any dramatic financial regulations like breaking up big banks or an High-frequency trading tax.\n* Homeland Security and transparency: Obama has modestly expanded the powers of these organizations after the large expansion under Bush, renewing large parts of the Patriot Act, allowing huge NSA domestic spying programs, and generally not being very transparent about these programs. I don't expect Clinton to change course very much. \n* Pro-Choice\n* Pro Gay marriage",

            "selftext": "So, almost everyone I know hates the possibility of either a president named Trump or Hillary, but we feel stuck in a system that forces us to choose the lesser evil. I feel like because of the very unpopularity of both major party candidates that it gives us a good solution.....\n\nWhat if we all found a partner in our state who is generally on the opposite side of us, and agree to vote for the same third party candidate? What I mean is, I am very liberal and have voted Democrat for the past few elections. My father is very conservative and has voted Republican as long as I've been alive. What if he and I both agreed to vote for the same third party candidate rather than either major party candidate?\n\nWe wouldn't be throwing away our vote to the major party candidate we hate the most because we'd be cancelling each other out. Since it's someone I know and trust, I can believe that he wouldn't double-cross me and vote Trump anyway. If we all did this, the 3rd parties would have a chance to actually become part of our national discussion. Even if they didn't win and we still end up stuck with one of our asshole major party candidates, THAT might actually send a message. \n\nEveryone thinking that if Trump gets elected because liberals who've been cheated by the DNC refuse to vote for Hillary, suddenly the party will change are disillusioned. As long as one of the two major parties is in control, we will never have change because they will keep us busy fighting on things like civil rights, religion, and who's at fault for what catastrophe. All the while, both parties get us in wars we don't like, take bribes from the rich and well-connected while giving out favors in return, and basically undermine the will of the people. \n\nI also feel that this would be a way to energize a disillusioned public and convince them that voting is still a worthwhile endeavor. It could help get more bodies at the polls. It continues the revolution in a non-violent way and gives people hope that change is possible.\n\nThen again, I'm sure there are weaknesses to my plan. Namely that it might be hard, after all our fighting, to find someone from the other side of the fence whom you trust to not just say they will vote 3rd party, but actually to do it. What else is wrong with my proposition?\n\nEDIT: I've amended my OP to say we don't necessarily need to all vote for the same 3rd party. We just need to agree not to vote for one of the two major party candidates.",

As long as I'm happy and comfortable I'd rather have him & the reason this applies is because everyone I know who votes Trump isn't constantly telling me \"VOTE, VOTE, VOTE!\". Also being to rallies both Trump and Bernie, i'll say bernie was more peaceful because of no protests but in Trump rallies i've been to it's always the protestors who are more violent. The shitty part is I know Trump is crazy but part of me thinks it's a sham & he's really friends with Hilary which makes it easier for me to justify voting for him. \n\nI also like to point out I don't actually have much against Hilary if she's just going to be like a female version of Obama, I never really cared about Wallstreet backing her since I don't hate wallstreet, I don't care about her email scandal or bengazhi. I just dislike her supporters so much that'd I'd rather see them lose. \n\nI feel like a narcissist just saying this but in all honesty, if my view is irrational, too anecdotal and selfish then I want to know. Part of me hates it but another part of me likes not caring about politics because it makes me happy but then again i'm constantly surrounded by it in person, facebook, youtube...everywhere, it's hard for someone like me to not have an opinion on something.\n\n\n_____\n\n> *Hello, users of CMV!

            "selftext": "I supported Bernie Sanders in the Democratic primaries this election cycle and personally identify as an independent. I do not wish to support Hillary Clinton or the Democratic Party, but I recognize at this point in the election cycle she is the only viable candidate opposing Donald Trump and the Republican Party, whom I will not support under any circumstance.\n\nThe common consensus among die-hard Bernie supporters is that we should vote for a third party in hopes that another party will get enough votes to receive federal funding and put forth a viable presidential candidate for the 2020 election cycle.\n\nThe common criticism of this is that historically votes for third-party candidates have done nothing but spoil elections, citing that President Bush would not have been elected if Nader hadn't taken so many votes from Gore.\n\nIgnoring the fallacy that many of these third-party votes were never going to go to Gore or in this case Hillary, **my argument instead is that this issue is nuanced, and specifically my argument is that the state you live in should play a role in your decision to vote third party.**\n\nFor instance, if you live in a swing state such as Ohio, and if your ideology is progressive and lines up with at least 70% of the Democratic Party's platform, voting for Hillary is likely your most strategic option regardless of whether or not you support her or her party.\n\nLikewise if you are like me and live in Tennessee, a historically red state, voting for Hillary will have roughly the same impact on this election cycle as voting third party. However, voting for a third party candidate - especially during this election cycle - could likely have a significant impact on the 2020 election cycle.\n\nIn one context it could be viewed as irresponsible to vote third-party, and in another context voting for Hillary could be viewed as a wasted opportunity.\n\nOf course this all assumes your ideology is progressive and anti-establishment. If you are truly pro-Hillary or conservative this obviously doesn't apply to you.\n\n_____\n\n> *Hello, users of CMV! This is a footnote from your moderators.

            "selftext": "Trump has been heavily criticized for his statements about wanting to build a 1,000 mile wall across the Mexican border.  What has gotten almost no attention at all, especially from Democrats and the media, is both Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama voted in favor to build a 700 mile fence across the Mexican border.\n\nIMO, if you're going to criticize Trump and call him a racist for wanting to build a 1,000 mile wall across the Mexican border then both Clinton and Obama should be seen as racists and heavily criticized for succeeded in building a 700 mile fence across the Mexican border.\n\nThat Trump's wall would be 30% longer than Clinton and Obama's is hardly a reason for one to be criticized and called a racist but not the other.  I also object to the idea that there's a significant difference between \"wall\" and \"fence\".  [This is what Clinton and Obama's fence](http://news.nationalgeographic.com/2016/03/160304-us-mexico-border-fence-wall-photos-immigration/) looks like.  I think arguing that there's is a fence and not a wall is nothing more than semantics.  \n\nCMV!\n\nEDIT:  As pointed out by /u/phcullen, it's the Secure Fence Act of 200*6* - not 2008.\n_____\n\n> *Hello, users of CMV!

            "selftext": "At the size and effectiveness of our government's influence, establishment ultimately decides the movements and trends that should be kept and which should be cut. It's also fair to say that they are indeed human like everybody else. They're just as selfish as the average person can be at times and likely prioritize themselves and their families above the country when making the majority of their decisions. For example, an individual getting elected to the highest position of authority based heavily by the influence their appearance had on America has snowballed in America's conscious up to today where an unhealthy number of people now identify the truth of authority with what they see on the surface of authority. This makes it easier for establishment to further solidify their authority in the eyes of the American people. \n\nThese kinds of things are vital for them because, without it, individuals outside establishment will grow the same wisdom and leadership that they only had trickle down for them from the founding fathers. \nDonald Trump scares them deeply because he doesn't need the presidency to ensure him and his family prosper in society, and their dependency of that is the root of bad leadership in a country defined by capitalism and democracy. The only path to tyranny in a country like America is through what the democratic party has been doing the past 8 years and what they plan to do now. If you follow their pattern, any buzzwords you hear now about Trump are likely the direction that establishment wants to go, it's how they cover their trail.\n\n_____\n\n> *Hello, users of CMV!

She has experience in politics, knows how to deal with foreign leaders and is a very highly educated person with knowledge of the world.

When looking at the two, one with years of experience and one with not, why would one choose the one with no experience?

I was just asking a question in the AmA. \n\nI got a message from /r/OffMyChest saying that I am banned for participating in a hate subreddit. This is absurd. They shouldn't be able to ban me for something I did on another subreddit. I think reddit should make this against the rules. \n\nIf the subreddit was an actual hate subreddit, reddit probably would have banned it. It's still up for a reason. Reddit hasn't even quarantined it. I don't even go on /r/The_Donald because I am not a Trump fan. I honestly get tired of seeing the spam on the front page. However, I think it's unfair to not allow Trump supporters on /r/OffMyChest. Lets say the /r/offmychest mods were Trump fans. Would they be allowed to ban me for participating on /r/SandersForPresident? \n\nIf this becomes a trend, it could really reduce the quality of reddit. Lets say if I make a post on /r/HipHopHeads and I get banned from /r/Music because the mods on music dont like hip hop. That is really unfair and causes me to have to limit my experience on reddit. I should be able to participate on any subreddit I wish, without the fear of mods from another subreddit banning me. \n\nWhat if more subreddits banned users from /r/The_Donald? This would literally limit subreddits that users could use. It also encourages people creating other accounts to circulate subreddits that they are banned from which is technically against the rules.\n\nIn conclusion, I think that this is really bad for reddit. Mods shouldn't have the power to limit what subreddits the users of their subreddit can go on. Reddit needs to ban this because if this trend catches on, reddit will really go down in quality and it will cause users to not be able to use a large variety of subreddits.\n_____\n\n> *Hello, users of CMV!

Everything is great and magnificent and huge. All of his opponents are sad and low energy. He doesn't stand on the strength of his convictions but on the strength of his bragging. His platform is we're going to make America great again. He doesn't say *how* he's going to make it great, or why it isn't great now. It's only that we aren't winning, and he'll make us win again.\n\nBefore taking a needless dig at the president, he said he [\"has the best words.\"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UIE_MRAhEA) Because for some reason he needed to brag in that moment.\n\n**He's Not Equipped to Be President**\n\nHe has shown time and again that he isn't particularly interested in being president, and that he isn't particularly familiar with what's going on. [He didn't have an idea on Brexit](http://thinkprogress.org/politics/2016/06/01/3783685/trump-didnt-know-about-brexit), one of the most consequential world events of recent memory. When he did finally comment on it, he did so [on a trip to Scotland, where he promoted his gold course, and said that a country that voted 62% to Remain was \"going wild\" for Brexit.](http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-scotland-glasgow-west-36606184) When asked about his foreign policy advisers, he \nsaid he listened to himself because he has [\"a very good brain.\"](http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2016/mar/17/donald-trump-i-consult-myself-on-foreign-policy-be/) \n\n**He Lies Consistently, Casually, and Needlessly**\n\nOf all the statements PolitiFact has rated, [18% are 'Pants on Fire' and 37% are 'False.'](http://www.politifact.com/personalities/donald-trump/) 55% of the things he says have *any* resemblance to the truth.

As just one of a multitude of examples, [Donald says that he recommended Ohio for the GOP convention.](http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2016/jul/18/donald-trump/trump-says-without-proof-he-recommended-ohio-gop-c/) The only problem is that it's demonstrably false. He never said that. There's no trace he ever said that. It's super easy to point this out.\n\nBut Trump says it anyway, because it picks him up ground. That's Trump's pattern--if he thinkgs something sounds good, he says it, regardless of its truth value.\n\n**He's A Gullible Conspiracy Theorist**\n\nDonald Trump has consistently said that he thinks Ted Cruz's father was involved in the JFK assassination. His source? [The National Enquirer.](http://radaronline.com/celebrity-news/ted-cruz-dad-lee-harvey-oswald-rafael-cruz-photos-experts/) \n\nNot to mention that Trump is the Original Birther. He said that he was [sending investigators to Hawaii to look into Obama's birth-certificate, and that \"they cannot believe what they're finding.\"](http://politicalticker.blogs.cnn.com/2011/04/21/trump-says-hell-reveal-interesting-things-on-obama/) Not to put to fine a point on it, but he made that up. If there ever were any investigators, which I doubt, they didn't find anything. This is another case where Trump says just whatever he thinks will gain him attention.\n\nAnd perhaps most damning, he's gullible. [Donald got caught up promoting a hoax video online.](http://thehill.com/blogs/ballot-box/presidential-races/272824-trump-all-i-know-is-whats-on-the-internet) His defense? \"All I know is what's on the internet.\" He literally just reposts things from the internet as fact without doing *any* due diligence. And his defense is that he didn't look into it?\n\n**tl;dr** In layman's terms, I hear Donald talk, and *there's no there there*. There's just someone shouting for attention, and saying whatever he thinks will get him attention. He's not a leader; he's a child.\n\nWhat do people see, and why do they find it attractive? What am I missing?\n\nedit: I want a case for Trump without reference to Hillary. I said that originally, but I just bolded it up top.",

            "selftext": "Before I get into my argument, I want to say I am a progressive and very much against the TTP.  But I had a thought last night that if congress passed the TTP, they would do MUCH better in the election.\n\nFirst, the reason why they want to wait until the lame-duck session is to avoid electoral lashback.  Senate members (less so in the house), feel they would get a blow back during their election, and some might.   But something to keep in mind is that democrats, especially Obama, will get the majority of the blowback because that's how it always works.  People blame republicans and Bush for the Iraq War, ignoring the hundreds of congress (including the majority of democrats) people that voted for it.   Same with NAFTA, Bill gets all the credit/blame, congress got off mostly scotfree in comparison.\n\nSecond, the Obama is almost guaranteed to sign it.  He has worked on this agree for 6 years and sees it as the capstone to his legacy.  There is 99% certainty that he would sign it.  And he would have to do it within 10 days.  He could veto it and try again in the lame-duck session.  But I don't think he would want to wait, he doesn't tend to play political games like that.\n\nThird, the uneasy 'unity' on the left would be completely disrupted if this happens.  Clinton is very weak on this issue, many of her own supporters don't even believe she is *actually* against the TTP.  And she won't condemn it outright, only saying she wouldn't 'pass it in its current state'.  Whatever that means.\n\nFourth, if Obama signs it, he will have to be taken off of the Clinton team.  Bernie delegates did a 'silent protest' of the TTP during Obama's speech out of the respect for the president.  Instead of the booing and chanting that many felt they should do.  If Obama actually signs it, he would get shouted down at any rallies and went to, and he would become more of a liability threatening unity then an asset to Clinton.\n\nSo in short, if republicans did pass it: they could mostly scapegoat Obama and dems, highlight a point where many people feel Trump is much better then Clinton on, disrupt the uneasy party unity, and remove a key Clinton board piece.\n\n_____\n\n> *Hello, users of CMV!

            "selftext": "As most of you probably know, Donald Trump did an AMA on /r/the_donald yesterday. I hold that it was a failure. This AMA could have had one of three conceivable goals.\n\nFirst, it could be intended to fire up the base. I don't think there's a base even remotely as fired-up right now as /r/The_Donald. Mr. Trump would be preaching to a choir that already knows the text of the sermon and is saying it right along.\n\nSecond, it could be intended to convince voters who are on the fence. If it was intended to do this, it did not succeed. Mr. Trump answered 9 questions (10 if you count a multiparter from /r/asktrumpsupporters where he only answered 2 of the 5 questions), and none of the answers provided any new information about his views or policy ideas. Most were 1-2 relatively short sentences largely devoid of substance.\n\nThird, it could be intended to thank /r/the_donald for their support. However, I deem this unlikely, because the risks of a bad AMA are much higher than simply making an official 'I'm Donald Trump and I want to thank Reddit for their support' type of post if the only goal is appreciation.\n\nHeck, even /r/asktrumpsupporters seems [disappointed](https://np.reddit.com/r/AskTrumpSupporters/comments/4uxuh8/as_a_supporter_is_anyone_else_uh_disappointed/) in the AMA.\n\n\n_____\n\n> *Hello, users of CMV!

            "selftext": "Most therapists, shrinks, health professionals, doctors, etc are legally obligated to keep what their client says as a secret unless they are planning to hurt somebody or themselves, which I think is fair and the way it should be, sans few specific cases.\n\nLet's say Dave and Anne are a couple with a newborn and they go to, say, a geneticist and they find out that their baby has inherited a disease that is deadly and will likely result in the child's death in a few years. Anne has previously disclosed to the geneticist that Dave is not the father of the child, but Dave does not know this. Let's also say that this disease, given Dave is a carrier, has a 50% chance to affect any future offspring that he may have. At the geneticist, they have blood samples and it is determined that Dave is not the father of the child with the disease. As such, Dave cannot is not a carrier of this genetic disorder.\n\nIn a situation like this, where the men are believed to carry the gene for a disease, some men might not want to take the risk of potentially having another child because they have a good chance of inheriting this fatal disease. I do not believe it is fair, or morally just, to allow this man, or anyone in this situation to abstain from having children because he wrongly believes he is a carrier of this disease.\n\nI know this is a very uncommon occurrence, and this hypothetical about the disease is very unlikely, but I would still like to know what other people think. Bottom line: Should fathers who are unknowingly not biologically the father of \"their\" children be informed of that involuntarily, or does the privacy of the mother trump that?\n\nI believe that it is immoral to withhold this information from the father.\n\nCMV.\n\nEdit: u/cacheflow brought up a good point that if \"Dave\"'s blood was taken, then it's his own medical history, and this doesn't apply. What about if there was no blood taken, but the child's diagnosis makes Dave assume that he is the father, and he lives his life thinking that he is a carrier of this fatal disorder? (In this situation the mother and the doctor are aware that Dave is not the father)\n\nEdit 2: Thanks for all the replies, glad it was kept a calm civil discussion. All in all I think I would consider this a half-delta, while I still don't necessarily agree with it, I definitely understand the other side A LOT more now. I never really realized how important the trust confidentiality agreement was in many aspects of life. Still couldn't get over the whole lying by omission to the father. Hopefully nobody here will ever have to go through that!\n\n\n_____\n\n\n\n\n> *Hello, users of CMV! This is a footnote from your moderators. We'd just like to remind you of a couple of things.

I'm also someone who has resisted all notions of Election Fraud. So  I'm not 100% sure yet, still. I need to do more research.\n\nBut let's say, hypothetically, it did happen.\n\nYou still have one of the most obvious choices there's ever been in an election. An overqualified candidate versus a grossly underqualified one. Someone who knows everything about what the job entails versus someone who has no idea what it entails. Someone who has no actual policy other than conspiracy theories and xenophobia versus a candidate with one of the most progressive platforms we've ever seen, who still has a moderate running mate, who is experienced when it comes to working with people who disagree with her, and who, yes, has made her share of mistakes, but is fully capable of the task at hand.\n\nSo if we assume that Election Fraud did occur, and that Hilary won the nomination by cheating, how does it change the fact that she is still clearly the better candidate by far? Third party votes accomplish nothing and I believe that they are morally irresponsible, I really, really doubt you can change my view there. Instead, I want to be convinced that Hilary getting away with election fraud in her own party is as potentially dangerous as Donald Trump.\n\n> *Hello, users of CMV!

            "selftext": "If there is a large portion of the electorate who are looking for change (in this case it would be the Sanders and Trump voters, but it applies to any election) any endorsement of a status quo candidate by those who already benefit from the status quo, unless they have some expertise in the field (for example economists, diplomats, or community leaders) is self-serving and should be ignored.\n\nIf we use this election as an example. Polls seem to suggest a close election between a change candidate(Trump) and a status quo candidate(Hillary). When you include the Sanders electorate though, who voted for another change candidate, it would suggest a majority of the American people want change. Those who endorse the change even when the benefit from the status quo, would suggest that they are not doing so for self-serving reasons. Those who benefit from the status quo telling others that they should vote for the status quo suggests, whether it is true or not, a very self-serving motive. An analogous situation it seems would be nobles endorsing a monarchy.\n\nThe only caveat is not choosing for a candidate, but choosing against one. You can denounce a candidate without endorsing one though, to use the current election as an example, many republican politicians are denouncing Donald Trump without endorsing Hilary Clinton.\n\nBut obviously in almost every election incumbents have had celebrity endorsements and nobody treats them as selfish, I'm trying to understand the argument for why these aren't self-serving and why candidates will often highlight their celebrity endorsements. I would like to see these endorsements in a more positive light. I would like to see the argument that these celebrities are not using their fame to benefit themselves by influencing elections that seem to go against what most of country wants. \n\n(This is not an anti-Hilary or Pro-trump/Sanders cmv, but specifically about those who endorse them)\n\n_____\n\n> *Hello, users of CMV!

            "selftext": "I'm struck by how ungodly atrocious this guy is. As a pretty liberal guy, I think I'd rather take my chances voting for Richard Nixon or infamous segregationist George Wallace over Trump in a theoretical election between the three. \n\nI'm not gonna enumerate every reason why Trump is viscerally revolting to me, but I will go into my reasoning here: \n\n1. As I understand it, Richard Nixon wasn't actually a terrible president by many metrics. He had experience as a California senator, representative, and with the vice presidency before running for high office. He opened American diplomacy with China, and created the EPA. \n\n2. Nixon may have been a paranoid civil liberties disaster, but he's nothing compared to Trump, who has asked a foreign nation to commit espionage against his political opponents for short term gain, promotes torture, and killing innocent civilians (\"you have to go after their families\"). \n\n3. They both ran on platforms of racism, but at least Nixon used dog whistles. Trump might as well march around with a bed sheet over his head. With a hypothetically well-informed and rational electorate, Nixon ought to win an election against Trump in a landslide. \n\n\n4. As for George Wallace, this is a much trickier one. He's infamous for his lifelong support of Segregation, but at least he had experience governing Alabama. Wallace didn't ever pose the international security threat that Trump does by promoting nuclear proliferation and aggressively suggesting that the United States abandon its allies. \n\n5. It's hard to see how Wallace's racial policies could be meaningfully worse than Trump's, and he didn't lash out at every insult and threaten democratic norms like the free press by blacklisting media outlets that hurt his widdle feelings. \n\n6. If George Wallace could uphold NATO and keep China from marching over Japan and Russia from occupying east-central Europe and potentially reigniting a potentially apocalyptic 2nd Cold War, I'd take him over Trump in a heartbeat.   \n_____\n\n> *Hello, users of CMV!

            "selftext": "I am all about respecting our heroes. I am all about being kind and respectful towards those who have lost their family members in any sort of circumstance. I think there are absolutely cases where public criticism of soldiers is at best unclassy and at worst ridiculous. But if you go on a national stage and denounce a man, he has every right to retaliate. If you criticize his policies, he has every right to defend them; and if you resort to ad hominem attacks and criticize his personality, he has every right to respond in kind.\n\nKhizr Khan fired personal shots at Trump. He asked him (sarcastically, of course) whether he even read the Constitution, and then offered him a copy he \u201chappened\u201d to have with him. This was not the solemn testimony of a grieving father; this was cynical political theatre orchestrated by a man with an agenda. And for what it\u2019s worth, I respect the agenda \u2013 I think demonization of Muslims as terrorists is absurd, especially since they are the primary victims of terrorism and many of them give their lives fighting against it.\n\nKhan accused Trump of never having sacrificed anything or anyone. I wish for all of us never to have to sacrifice anyone, but more to the point, Khan has attacked Trump\u2019s character and integrity. Trump\u2019s response was as follows:\n\n> While I feel deeply for the loss of his son, Mr. Khan who has never met me, has no right to stand in front of millions of people and claim I have never read the Constitution, (which is false) and say many other inaccurate things.\n\nSuddenly, Trump is an un-American blasphemer with a \u201cBlack Soul\u201d (Khan\u2019s words!) for daring to insult the family of a hero. But the family lost any sort of sacred protection they had the moment they started slinging mud. You can\u2019t wade into a fight and expect your social context to protect you from counterattacks. And the vast amount of political figures and private citizens who have pounced on Trump is equally ludicrous. For Trump, that was about as respectful as it ever gets. He did his best to respect the heroic sacrifice of the Khan family while firing back against attacks on his personality. I don\u2019t think I could have been classier than Trump in that situation, and that\u2019s not a sentence I speak often.\n\nSo I guess that\u2019s my point. It\u2019s pretty simple (and I\u2019m having a little trouble inflating it to the required 500 words per post), and can be summed up as such: someone who starts a fight cannot claim special protection when the other guy chooses to retaliate.\n\nI'm not on Trump's side. I never will be. I\u2019m a non-Christian foreigner and his entire premise scares the shit out of me. I just think his criticizers need to address his words rather than pretend his target is sacrosanct.\n\nEdit: I missed it, but Trump also suggested Mrs. Khan's silence was because she had \"nothing to say,\" or perhaps wasn't allowed to say anything. I'd argue (and feel free to argue back) that by standing there she was backing her husband's speech and thus is fair game for Trump's retaliation, childish though it might be. Was his insult of her also racist/islamophobic? Quite possibly. We should focus on that instead of whether or not Trump is allowed to attack her.\n\nEdit 2: \"There used to be some things that were sacred in American politics -- that you don't do -- like criticizing the parents of a fallen soldier even if they criticize you.\" -Lindsey Graham\n\n\n_____\n\n> *Hello, users of CMV!

            "selftext": "There is a certain American presidential candidate out there who infamously advocates the banning of foreign Muslims from entering America under the pretense of protecting America due to the rise of Islamic fundamentalist terrorism.\n\nHowever, if we are truly wishing to protect America and her citizens from terrorism, we should also ban foreign Jews from entering America as well. According to [this](https://www.fbi.gov/stats-services/publications/terrorism-2002-2005#terror_05sum) FBI publication, which documents every terrorist attack committed on American soil between 1980 until 2005, it would appear that more Jews committed attacks in the name of their religion on American soil than Muslims. \n\nHere are the facts: in total, there were 318 attacks that occurred. Islamic extremists committed 6% of the attacks and Jewish extremists committed 7% of the attacks. (Although it isn't relevant to this discussion, if you care here are the remaining statistics: Communists 5%, Left wing extremists 24%, Latinos 42%, and other groups 16%.)\n\nI am not arguing whether or not it is ethical, moral, or constitutional to ban Muslims (or anyone else) from entering America. For the purpose of discussion let us assume Trump is elected and this is something that is already happening. According to Trump, it is crucial to ban Muslims from entering America because over the span of two and a half decades, Muslim extremists committed 6% of the terrorist attacks which occurred in America. However, Jewish extremists committed 7% of the attacks, which is a higher figure. Therefore, I argue that if we are going to ban Muslims from entering the country due to Islamic terrorism, we should also ban Jews from entering the country due to Jewish terrorism, because according to the FBI, *Jews are more of a threat to Americans than Muslims.* Try to change my view.\n\nEDIT: View somewhat changed (the data might not be the best...)\n\n_____\n\n> *Hello, users of CMV!

            "selftext": "In the current US election for instance, people are attacking both Clinton and Trump for their lack of integrity, morals, values, etc. and act as if their preferred candidate is some amazing and virtuous individual who has near perfect integrity and only the best interests of the country at heart. This is not true and has not been true for the entirety of US history. \n\nA quick look at the statements rated by Politifact as pants-on-fire for Clinton and Trump show that both them have a great proclivity to lie when they feel it beneficial. \nhttp://www.politifact.com/personalities/donald-trump/statements/byruling/pants-fire/\nhttp://www.politifact.com/personalities/hillary-clinton/statements/byruling/pants-fire/\n(Note that while Clinton has much less pants-on-fire ratings from politifact she has a quite a few false rating which clearly also demonstrate her lack of honesty.)\n\nIt is because of this, that I view voting on the basis of integrity to be a very flawed way to participate in shaping the country and can in some cases produce very undesirable results. Such as voting for Trump purely because of a lack of integrity from Clinton, when Trump will surely make many lies in his presidency and also likely break many of his promises he made during his campaign. \n\nPersonally, I vote strictly on the basis of ideology and policy as politicians have shown throughout US history that they are incapable of being honest and free from scandal. Which makes sense considering...politicians are human beings just like the rest of us. They make mistakes, evolve on issues, lie, cheat, but ultimately they all have a vision for this country and that is based on their ideology and the policies they propose.\n\nFor myself, that means voting for Clinton as she is currently the highest match up with me on isidewith.com and after reviewing her website and policies, she is my best choice for shaping the country in my vision. \n\nI encourage all to take the take the quiz on isidewith.com and see who you really match up with best ideologically.\n\n\nAlso, a common argument I hear for voting for integrity instead of policy is when a candidate has a long history of flip flopping on issues they should not be voted for as their proposed policies cannot be trusted. My problem with that is that, at least in the context of US elections, the opposition to that candidate typically has polar opposite views proposed. It is just flat nonsensical to vote for a candidate on the basis on integrity and hope for them to change their position on crucial issue during the presidency because the candidate who did represent your stances had a history of lacking integrity and consistency. Also at least in the US, it is virtually impossible for third party candidates to win on account of our first-past-the-post voting system regardless of how much integrity they 'seem' to have. A third party candidate can only act as a spoiler candidate to the major party candidate who has the ideology closes to them. \n\n_____\n\n> *Hello, users of CMV!

            "selftext": "First off, I don't like either of the mainstream candidates AT ALL...or the NY Post for that matter. All three are icky. \n\nPlus, it's really hard to explain why I feel this whole naked pics of a POTUS candidate's wife thing just ain't right, aside from saying that if Michelle Obama had posed for naked photos in the past, wingnuts would be foaming at the mouth and jabbering through every available media outlet. Some, like [Huffington Post pundit A. M. Mitchell](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/on-melania-trumps-nude-photos_us_579f4ab2e4b07066ba1f5bfd) have \"huffily\" declared that they \"don't care about Melania Trump's nude photos and neither should  you.\" \n\nHere, for the uninitiated, are some examples: \n\n[GQ UK's \"The Future First Lady?\" using shots from \"over 15 years ago](http://www.gq-magazine.co.uk/article/donald-trump-melania-trump-knauss-first-lady-erections)\n\n[NY Post: Girl-on-girl shots](http://nypost.com/2016/08/01/melania-trumps-girl-on-girl-photos-from-racy-shoot-revealed/)\n\nThere's nothing wrong with posing naked for photographs. Nothing wrong with making money from or showing off your beauty. And true, on the face of it, Melania is quite attractive and true, she herself isn't running for office. But both of these statements are rather naive in regard to the wife, or husband, of the POTUS, which let's face it, is a position of supreme trust. Public scrutiny and judgement of your family is an inevitable result of high office and sure, some of it is unfair/unhelpful. But with great power comes great responsibility...and a high price.\n\nPerhaps I think it's icky because a family is a reflection of its members and because the \"first family\" subconsciously represents and embodies the collective ideal of what a family should be. Perhaps I think it's icky because it's a shitty example for the nation's millions of young girls--how the hell are you going to tell your daughter you don't want her posing naked when she can hit back with \"but the First Lady did it, and look where she is today...?\"\n\nJust as Bill Clinton's sleazy past bad acts tarnish his wife as President, so do naked pics of the FLOTUS cast an undesirable light on Trump. Especially in other countries and even more especially given the sort of moral outrage to which conservatives seem especially prone of late. To say the least of it, it is a \"first\" I never thought I would see happen...and it seems surreal that it's happened without much hullabaloo (so far). \n\nAnd I gotta say this...maybe it is because it's because I'm totally grossed out by the idea of ANYBODY fucking Donald Trump. Don't care how much loot the old orange bastard has...just eew. \n\n_____\n\n> *Hello, users of CMV! This is a footnote from your moderators. We'd just like to remind you of a couple of things.

            "selftext": "The current argument for the inequality between parental rights between men and women is that a woman is allowed to have an abortion because it's her right to bodily autonomy. While I agree with this argument, I believe that this argument loses all merit when artificial wombs are available. I believe that when artificial wombs are advanced enough to be a viable method of sustaining the fetus, that a pregnant woman should not be able to get an abortion, and must instead get whatever this new procedure. \n\n\nI hold this view because of two main reasons. \n\n1. Parental rights equality would be established by forcing both genders to have no right, post conception, to get out of parenthood.\n2. It would appease people who believe that person hood begins at conception while also appeasing the people who believe that a woman's right to bodily autonomy trump the rights of the unborn fetus.\n\nI believe that it is immoral to utilize abortion to get out of parenthood because it causes a parental rights inequality, and I believe this immorality is only tolerated because of the net good done by respecting bodily autonomy. When artificial wombs are viable however, the woman would maintain equivalent bodily autonomy, no longer be able to dictate whether or not someone lives or dies, and would still be on the hook as a parent post conception. \n\nEdit 1: To clarify, in this system people would still be able to give their children up for adoption and/or have child support payments from an unwilling parent (And in saying that I found a third reason I enjoy this proposal. It would allow for the situation where the father wants to keep the child and the mother doesn't to finally work out). \n\nEdit 2: I've given out one delta already and I want to put the slightly modified view up here. I still believe that abortion should be outlawed and replaced with moving the fetus to the artificial womb, but that we need to wait until artificial wombs are viable and contraception has reached the point where unintended pregnancies are significantly decreased. \n_____\n\n> *Hello, users of CMV!

He doesn't care about the poor or oppressed. He has always been degrading towards women and minorities. Trump doesn't strike me as intelligent or rational. I'm not of the opinion that if he was elected president, Trump would drive this nation into the ground or anything extreme like that. I just do not understand how Americans have gotten behind him.\n\nHe just seems like the opposite kind of candidate Americans are usually inspired by, being a born into wealth A-List celebrity. This seems like the most obvious example ever of someone running for president purely to have power and be in the spotlight. \n\nPlease someone give me an intelligent view from the other side, I'm sick of hearing \"I like him because he speaks his mind.\" I want to know what I'm missing here.\n\n_____\n\n> *Hello, users of CMV!

Instances where people with authority behave radically and outside the law. Their lawless actions are often covered up by their peers and superiors.

            "selftext": "US General Election. You have two major candidates that have the worst negatives in history. I am an independent voter, and I believe myself to be fairly moderate. I will not vote for Trump, I don't believe he is a good person, and I think he is completely unprepared to be president. I believe in the #NeverTrump movement, not as a Republican, but as an independent who thinks that much of what the country stands for will deteriorate, and our/the global economy will be much worse off, despite his business acumen. So my task is to find a way to not let him WIN in November. This is not my CMV, just the context. Here is my personal basic description of the other two candidates which I would vote for:\n\nHillary Clinton has almost every checkbox on her resume, and I think that whether or not her foreign policy has helped or hurt the world, the experience is a huge factor for me. (I'm a firm believer that it is near impossible to objectively and accurately judge the effects of cabinet members'/presidents' actions before 3-5 presidential terms have passed for historical perspective) Some of her domestic policies are not in line with my views, but I could live with it.\n\nGary Johnson has executive experience, and I agree with many of his policies domestically. Although I don't currently believe he has the experience to deal with the complexities of the foreign policy playing field, I think he is more equipped and willing to listen to foreign policy advisers than Trump, so I think we'd be ok. I also agreed with his policies on the support website that's been going around more than any other candidate (by only 3% over Hillary, 87% to 84%). I think these sites create a choice bias because of the wording of the questions and the answers which you can select. There is no way to fully explain your view, and they only let you pick between the ideas of the candidates.\n\nI will phrase my dilemma as a question because at the moment I am leaning toward Hillary, but I'm still somewhat undecided: **Am I right to vote for Hillary basically as a pragmatic vote to stop Trump from gold plating the white house? Or should I vote for Gary because I align more with his views, and hope my vote doesn't help Trump get elected?**\n\nEDIT: I am from a so-called swing-state in this general election cycle.\n\n_____\n\n> *Hello, users of CMV!

I tell them that I think all of the candidates are terrible, and they repeat the same message and throw in a history lesson about how blacks can't vote. I still tell the same thing, and in addition say that I should vote because I want to, not because I'm obligated to. A wacky argument that I was presented with by my father is that \"you have every right to note vote, but don't complain afterwards\" and that \"I can't complain if the wrong candidate wins\". The thing is, even if I did vote for someone, I'd still be complaining about how shitty they are. And another thing is that my father voted for Obama because Obama was black and my father believed that Obama would be reaching out to the black community more and give us more benefits. WRONG, he didn't. He ended up picking the wrong candidate who did not do the things my father voted for him to do. I told my father that voting does not give you the \"right\" to complain as anyone is allowed to do. But still, I get scolded for purposely not voting. ",

I have dedicated hours on the web, typing in searches like \"Donald Trump intelligent points\" or \"Donald Trump smartest quotes\" I get nothing but speculation and inflated rhetoric on his part. My favorite was when he was talking to Bill O'Reilly, claiming that ISIS [\"has our passport machines and are making them better than we are.\"](http://therightscoop.com/in-trumps-alternate-reality-isis-stole-our-passport-machines-and-prints-better-passports-than-we-do/) He says things like this that are just so obviously unresearched, speculatory, and likely all around false that it just makes it so hard for me to like him. \n\nHe doesn't offend me, but he's just not a good public speaker when he doesn't have something to warn about. I highly doubt he's actually as foolish as the news makes him out to be (or even believes half of the things he says), and I suspect the *only* way a republican will ever make it into office again is if a candidate panders to the outrage culture that is so prevalent nowadays. But it makes me nervous to think that he is in fact as ignorant as lets off, and I have little other evidence to suggest that he's not- aside from the fact that somehow he's this close to becoming leader of the free world, despite how 'progressive' the majority of mainstream American life has become. \n\nTl;dr: I want to feel safer about our political options, but everyone's leading me to believe it will be the end of the world. CMV!\n\nTo be fair, [this interview](https://youtu.be/i60MVlYb7FM?t=4m5s) he did with Jim Cramer in 2008 was the one video I found where he actually sounded like an intelligent guy. Why doesn't he speak like this more often instead of harping on the same fucking thing over and over again? \n_____\n\n> *Hello, users of CMV! This is a footnote from your moderators.

While he fought for the Republican Nomination he said Mexicans are rapists, terrorists families should be murdered and that we shouldn't allow Muslim refugees into this country and we should put the ones here on a register. The second the Presidential race officially started at the National Conventions he has been steadily losing ground due to the onslaught of attacks by the Democrats and his complete inability to handle them, and we're in the third week of it I believe. He is so far right that the already far right Republicans have to distance themselves from their own candidate every other day, that to me sounds like an extremist. He refuses to release his taxes claiming it's because he's being audited, but even Nixon released his when the same happened to him and we impeached him. He won't listen to Reince Priebus, a man who actually has to coach him through his campaign. So change my view, make me think that you are a level headed person that has came to support him on your own without using an argument used by the GOP, and make me think he has what it takes to handle the Oval Office.

            "selftext": "I don't like Trump. Hillary seems *by far* less insane. But I just read a few things that are now making me think the world might be safer if Trump takes presidency than Clinton. Especially considering a recent press conference with Putin [discussing his concerns](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqD8lIdIMRo) (which are surprisingly very reasonable).\n\nPremise is this:  Hillary's consistent behavior as Secretary of State in the Obama Administration has proved her among the most hawkish, pro-military action voices in the US.\n\nTrump is far more stupid and inexperienced than Hillary. He will have simpler propositions for all our foreign affairs. This may be taken advantage of, but because we are still the most militarized country on earth, he wont be able to make catastrophic mistakes militarily because A) we have the means to deal more damage than any other country if need be, and B) we have great advisers that wouldn't let Trump simply escalate to nukes without due cause, some even threatening to step down if requests become too ridiculous. \n\nYes he is a caveman brute regarding most of his ideas, and he will give a stronger voice to all the sexists, bigots, racists, etc, out there. But that will be only momentarily. And that is also besides the point.\n\nHe doesn't have the intelligence to cunningly and slowly escalate the world to a next world war, whereas Hillary is a different story. Her track record has her consistently making \"calculated\", militaristic decisions that after a decade the majority always thinks to be a mistake.\n\nExamples:\n\n* ~~Clinton signed the Iraq Liberation Act (1998) which helped set the stage for the Bush administration\u2019s disastrous decision to invade Iraq in 2003~~ EDIT: When asked in 2002 about the Iraq Liberation Act, Hillary declared, \u201cI agreed with it in 1998. I agree with it [now].\u201d In her 2003 book, Living History, she quotes her own remarks to the press \u201cas bombs fell on Iraq\u201d during Desert Fox: \u201cI think the vast majority of Americans share my approval and pride in the job that the president\u2019s been doing for our country.\u201d\n* Consistently lobbies to send more troops in to Afghanistan\n* She supported the expansions of NATO despite another superpower saying it will not be tolerated\n* Was a \"cheerleader\" in the Libyan intervention exercise of American (mis)management for regime change leading to chaos\n* She has publicly likened Vladimir Putin to Adolf Hitler, an insult that no one dared to apply to Russian (Soviet) leaders during the 50 years of the Cold War.  That coming from our nation\u2019s senior diplomat virtually closes the door on diplomacy and reason, leaving us with brute force to settle our differences. \n* She has called repeatedly for providing lethal weapons to Ukraine, which, if implemented would put us on a direct collision course with Russia.  \n* She has called for establishing a no-flight zone in Syria well after the Russians introduced their air force assets, including a highly advanced air defense system covering all of Syrian air space/ The result of implementing her recommendations in Syria would be direct armed conflict with the Russian forces in the region if we attempted to enforce an interdiction. (And de jure, we  would be in the wrong, because Russian presence has the express support of the Syrian government, whereas ours does not.)\n* Though not an example itself, the Neocon vultures that took control of US foreign and military policy under Bush-Cheney are now avid supporters of Hillary's candidacy...\n\nSummary:\n\nTrump is the worse human being. He will give a stronger, momentary voice to those filled with hate and fear. Hillary is a first-world warmonger. With her misguided sophistication, she will guide us to another world war. \n\nI think a few years of hate speech (which will not happen without protests)  is  better than the alternative of likely war.\n\n___________________\n\nhttps://consortiumnews.com/2016/07/27/the-fear-of-hillarys-foreign-policy/\n\nhttp://www.zerohedge.com/news/2016-08-04/war-or-peace-essential-question-american-voters-november-8th\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Senate_career_of_Hillary_Rodham_Clinton\n\nhttps://www.washingtonpost.com/news/morning-mix/wp/2016/02/28/former-cia-director-military-may-refuse-to-follow-trumps-orders-if-he-becomes-president/\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqD8lIdIMRo\n\nI hope this isn't too long.

            "selftext": "(If you're already familiar with the TD censorship controversy, than just start reading from the 4th last paragraph to save yourself some time).\n\nFirst off, remember comment rule #1 -- don't post comments that are in support of my view. I understand many of you support my view and (regardless of whether you are pro or anti Trump) disapprove of /r/the_donald, but truth be told, I'm interested in hearing arguments that *support* that sub. (For the rest of this post, \"TD\" refers to /r/the_donald).\n\nSome disclaimers here: \n\n* My [2nd most upvoted](https://www.reddit.com/r/The_Donald/comments/4nqx1c/rthe_donald_congratulations_on_defeating/) post is on TD, and while I very much stand strong in my criticisms of /r/news, I now **repudiate the naivety that is present in that post**.\n\n* With Bernie out and Hilary in, I am a Trump supporter. However, I, at least for the moment, **am not looking for this CMV to be about whether or not Trump is a good candidate** -- I am looking for discussion about TD.\n\n* This post is explicitly not defending the actions of /r/news (and the allegations against the admins) with regards to how they censored the news.\n\nMoving on:\n\nNow as many of you may know, TD is a rather censoring website. First off all, most fundamentally, the sub [blatantly states that it only permits pro-Trump posts](http://imgur.com/a/Xy5Du) -- this is not something hidden, this is not something secretive, this is not something that they themselves dispute -- this is something it it so proud of that it outright states it. It will not tolerate posts that challenge Trump. Second off, it banned accounts and deleted posts during Trump's AMA. And these are just some examples. I'm not defending everything in [this list](https://www.reddit.com/r/EnoughTrumpSpam/top/), but some of those look like genuine examples of censorship.\n\nSo frankly, it should seem quite clear that TD is a site that censors and explicitly wants only pro-Trump content. Now, truth be told, if people want to go on a site that censors information this systematically, then that's fine -- they're adults, I don't particularly care. It's their choice, the sub is allowed to censor what they want, and the visitors of that site can choose to do what they wish. But here's the problem...\n\nTD **claims** to disapprove of censorship. It claims to be [the last bastion of free speech on the internet](https://www.reddit.com/r/The_Donald/comments/4nqic8/the_donald_is_the_last_bastion_of_free_speech_on/). It has proudly [repudiated](https://www.reddit.com/r/The_Donald/comments/4uygib/heres_what_happened_with_donald_trumps_ama_on_rall/) [censorship](https://www.reddit.com/r/The_Donald/comments/4uxqa7/reddit_has_removed_the_trump_iama_from_the_top_of/). Again, I am not claiming that r/news or the admins were in the right to censor -- I am just pointing out the hypocrisy here.\n\nAFAIK, TD's primary response to allegations of censorship... is [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/The_Donald/comments/4vikse/announcement_who_benefits_from_concern_trolling/). I don't buy into it. When they post this, they are saying (at least I interpret them as saying) \"We believe we have very good reasons to censor, so we censor\". Well come on! You, by proving you love censorship, are **demonstrating exactly why people have censored things on Reddit! You are denouncing people for not following standards you explicitly refuse to follow**! When it comes to political news, here's how it works: either people should be allowed to say **whatever** they want (must be universal, regardless of who it benefits), or people need to be censored. Can't be selectively applied.\n\nNow, there are some situations where I believe censorship is okay. Examples of this are when you post spam content, when you post inappropriate/NSFW content without warning, when you dox, when you encourage or directly express intent to commit crimes -- yeah, all of those things have some grey areas, but they're acceptable. However, claiming to reject censorship and love free speech on a site that is pro-Trump, and then censoring anti-Trump rhetoric, is not legitimate.\n\nI really have found myself growing impatient with TD, and the reason I find this particularly frustrating is how TD is Trump's most popular subreddit.\n\nI welcome your attempts to CMV. But again, just remember that this CMV is about /r/the_donald -- it is **NOT** about Trump as a political candidate.",

            "selftext": "Donald Trump [said this at a rally in NC today](http://www.latimes.com/nation/politics/trailguide/la-na-trailguide-updates-donald-trump-says-second-amendment-1470771050-htmlstory.html):\n\n>\u201cHillary wants to abolish, essentially abolish the 2nd Amendment. By the way, and if she gets to pick if she gets to pick her judges, nothing you can do folks. Although the 2nd Amendment people, maybe there is. I don\u2019t know.\u201d\n\nMany people interpreted this as encouraging his supporters to assassinate either Clinton or her judicial appointments. \n\nThe Trump campaign has since come out and claimed that Trump was talking about Second Amendment advocates unifying to vote against Hillary. For example, Mike Pence said:\n\n>\"Of course not. Donald Trump is urging people around this country to act consistent with their convictions in the course of this election. And people who cherish the 2nd Amendment have a very clear choice in this election.\"\n\n**Now, to be clear, we have no way of knowing what Trump *meant*, so all we can debate is the meaning of the actual words he said.**\n\nI hold that if we go by what he SAID, the only possible interpretation is one of advocating violence. The key is in this sentence:\n\n>**if she gets to pick her judges**, nothing you can do folks. Although the 2nd Amendment people, maybe there is. \n\nAs the \"if...\" clause makes clear, in this part of the speech he's making a hypothetical about what will happen if Hillary is elected president. The Trump campaign explanation for his statement thus makes no sense...IF Hillary gets to pick her judges, there is nothing the Second Amendment folks could do about that by voting, because if Hillary is picking judges then the election is *already over*. \n\nTo put it another way: Trump's assertion is that Second Amendment folks might be able to do something \"if Hillary is picking judges.\" There's no way he could be referring to voting, because if Hillary is picking judges, the voting has already happened. Moreover, Trump suggests that only second amendment people (gun owners) would have a chance of doing something about her judicial choices. From his own statement, we know that he is:\n\n1. Not talking about voting, because in his hypothetical the voting has already happened, and...\n2. He is specifically singling out gun owners as being the ones able to affect a change.\n\nHow can this statement possibly be interpreted as anything other than a suggestion that second amendment advocates might shoot Clinton or her appointees? \n\nI'm not sure whether I can be convinced or not, but I'm open to changing my view if you can provide a convincing argument that Trump's words could be reasonably interpreted to mean something else. \n_____\n\n> *Hello, users of CMV!

I posted a lot of views, and while not all have been changed, y'all did correct quite a few. Thanks, again!\n\nI'm a soldier, and I want to be able to proudly serve under my next president. The only problem is I absolutely hate Hillary Clinton. Like, entirely despise her. Below I will post what I believe, and they are beliefs I don't want to believe in. Please change my views. In my oath of service I swore to obey the Constitution above the president. I don't want to spend the next 4-8 years believing I'm not following my oath.\n\nI see her as a puppet to huge donors, such as massive corporations, and foreign nations like Saudi Arabia. She has no care for the actual American people. She gets away with ger crimes due to her power alone. Anyone else who has done even a fraction of what she's done would be locked away for life or executed.\n\nThe majority of the media is basically in her pocket and ignores everything she does wrong, while making everything any other candidate does headline news. It highlights how corrupt our media is.\n\nThere is evidence of voter fraud against Bernie Sanders and I worry she may attempt it again against Trump and Johnson. It undermines democracy itself, and frankly how little anyone seems to care about this pisses me off. She was losing in the polls until polling companies changed their algorithms, making it look like she has support when she doesn't. She's doing this to make her voter fraud less obvious.\n\nHer proposed gun legislation is absolutely unconstitutional, and is a direct threat to our social contract as a nation and our ability to defend ourselves against other people, and most importantly, our government. I feel like if it were up to her, I would not be able to defend myself. Props to anyone who can change this view in particular. I'm a historian by education, and I know that it is against everything the founding fathers believed when they designed our nation. It's something I'm incredibly passionate about. All others aside, this alone is enough to make sure she never gets my vote.\n\nWhile social issues are important, she devotes far too much time talking about social problems, and spends too little time proposing economic reform or foreign policy reform. And what foreign policy she does advocate, will likely be the same kind of interventionist meddling in other nations, arms distribution bullshit.\n\nSyrian refugees are not our problem, and even if 99% of them are great people, there is still the chance of bringing in terrorists, which is unacceptable. All incoming people should be subject to the legal process of immigration. No exceptions.\n\nTerrorism is a threat to our nation, and she downplays it as if it is not. Even if it happens infrequently, the fact that it happens at all is reason enough to take any necessary action.\n\nDNC opponents are dropping like flies. They seem to be dying left and right. I don't see how it can be a coincidence.\n\nTrump is far from perfect, but I think his policies are safer for national security, and with him, even if he says dumb things every now and then, I have no doubts about his unwavering patriotism, and as far as crime goes, he is far less guilty. This part isn't really in contention. I don't want this to turn into an anti-Trump-fest. I want to actually change my views of Hillary herself. It seems the only arguments I ever actually hear for Hillary are really just anti-Trump shit and have nothing to do with her.",

They can scoop foods, such as rice, more than knives. They can cut meat arguably as well as forks, if anything slightly less. They can generally scoop things up better. Forks admittedly are better at eating spaghetti. But the trump card is that spoons are by far the best at eating cereal, oatmeal, soup, and other pseudo drinks.

I'm just referring to the eating utensils in terms of eating, forks spoons and knives.\n\n\nEdit 3: I have been partially convinced in the sense that other utensils are very important, and forks are the most useful, but I still retain the opinion that spoons can complete more functions\n",

            "selftext": "In my view, it is exceedingly difficult to support Donald Trump in an intelligent and thought-out manner. I don't find it to be a mere coincidence that most policy wonks and technocrats, ranging from left-of-center to right-of-center in political orientation, are terrified of a Trump presidency. Top analysts and experts at The Economist, Wonkblog, Vox, Wall Street Journal, FiveThirtyEight, The Upshot, Christian Science Monitor, let alone countless think tanks across the political spectrum (Brookings, Cato, Heritage, etc.), have harshly condemned Trump's candidacy for being largely devoid of details or even broad policy proposals, let alone proposals based on the weight of evidence. \n\nTrump's core constituency, based on polling and other demographic surveys, are middle age, non-university educated, working class, white and male, while educated voters across all demographics are rejecting Trump. Educated voters are supporting Hillary Clinton if they're more left-leaning, or Gary Johnson if they're more right-leaning. The very few \"intelligent\" people to have endorsed Trump (Donald Rumsfeld, Peter Thiel, Carl Icahn, etc.) have done so mainly because they don't want a Democrat in the White House and want a conservative SCOTUS. \n\nIf someone is genuinely supporting Trump, they are essentially supporting a \"bullshit artist,\" having lost much of his connection with reality. Liars are acutely aware of what they perceive to be the truth, but Trump has shown complete recklessness and disregard for the fact. Here are some things he's said:\n\n- disputed obama's birth certificate and U.S. citizenship, was at the heart of the 2011 birther movement, and publicly doubted Obama was born in the U.S.\n- said by Obama's own admission, he was born in Kenya \n- publicly suggested Obama didn't attend Columbia University \n- suggested that Obama is a Muslim back in 2011\n- said that he sent investigators to Hawaii to examine Obama's birth, but investigators weren't sent\n- called for implementing 45% tariff on Chinese goods and leaving the WTO, which professional economists almost unanimously think is insane \n- called anthropogenic climate change a hoax created by the Chinese to make American manufacturing non-competitive\n- viewed asbestos as a safe and effective fire retardent \n- linked vaccines to an autism epidemic, saying he's actually seen vaccines directly causing autism\n- said he saw thousands of american muslims celebrating 9/11 in New Jersey, despite this being thoroughly debunked \n- called for banning non-citizen Muslims from the U.S.\n- supported creating a database for Muslims in America, and called profiling Muslims \"common sense\"\n- defended the internment of Japanese-Americans in World War II\n- said he'll swiftly deport 11 undocumented immigrants, praising the 1950's era Operation Wetback as a model\n- mocked a disabled reporter on live television \n- said ISIS provides phones to refugees seeking to enter the U.S., without any evidence\n- said that the \"real\" unemployment rate is 42%, despite being thoroughly debunked, and receiving pants on fire and 4 Pinocchio ratings by fact checkers \n- said that the unemployment rate is 23%, despite being thoroughly debunked, and receiving pants on fire and 4 Pinocchio ratings by fact checkers \n- ignorantly claimed China was part of the TPP\n- alleged that Ted Cruz\u2019s father, Rafael, collaborated with Lee Harvey Oswald, the assassin of President John F. Kennedy to assassinate JFK, and cited the Lee Harvey Oswald claim from an article in the National Enquirer \n- said he has proof that mexico is sending criminals and rapists to the U.S., even though this has been thoroughly debunked\n- didn't know the difference between the Quds, members of the Iranian Revolutionary Guards, and the Iraqi Kurds\n- thought women are only valuable for how they look, with at least a dozen high-profile misogynistic comments\n- defended his penis size on a presidential debate stage \n- asserted that he'd have the military kill the innocent family members of terrorists, and bring back waterboarding and \"much worse\" (despite evidence showing \"enhanced interrogation\" failed to produce actionable intelligence)\n- called the Geneva Conventions a problem\n- stated that he's fine with prosecuting U.S. citizens in Guantanamo Bay  \n- vowed to seize Syria's oil fields and refineries, which help keep ISIS afloat, and then sell the oil to pay for a U.S. military campaign. However, if the U.S. actually stole the oil, it would only net about $500 million, at most. A year long excursion in Syria of 20,000-30,000 U.S. troops (which trump has called for) would realistically cost around $25 billion\n- incorrectly thought Tim Kaine was the governor of New Jersey, despite Chris Christie being one of Trump's most vocal backers \n- thought he could address America's fiscal issues by reneging on U.S. sovereign debt, an idea that was universally panned by economists since it would trigger a worldwide recession much worse than 2008\n- refused to initially disavow KKK endorsements, David Duke, and other white nationalists/supremacists backing him, saying he didn't \"know anything\" about Duke and white supremacists \n- reposted and retweeted anti-Semitic symbols \n- retweeted a bogus crime graphic comparing black-on-black murders to police violence\n- retweeted a nazi-sympathizing white supremacist \n- encouraged violence at his rallies multiple times, lamented about how \"their used to be consequences\" for protesters, justified violence by protesters saying that the \"country has to toughen up,\" and \u201cmaybe he should have been roughed up because it was absolutely disgusting what he was doing,\" and \u201cI don\u2019t know if I\u2019ll do the fighting myself, or if other people will\"\n- said \u201cI\u2019d like to punch him in the face,\" after Trump supporter sucker-punched a protester at a rally (and later threatened to kill him if he showed up again), with Trump saying, \"He was swinging, he was hitting people, and the audience hit back. That\u2019s what we need a little bit more of\"\n- said about protesters, \"if you see somebody getting ready to throw a tomato, knock the crap out of them, would you? Seriously, OK? Just knock the hell \u2014 I promise you, I will pay for the legal fees. I promise. I promise\" \n- supported unequivocally his former campaign manager, Corey Lewandowski, when he assaulted Brietbart News reporter Michelle Fields\n- said a judge in the Trump University case was biased against Trump because of the judge's Mexican heritage \n- said Obama and Hillary founded ISIS, then said he was being \"sarcastic,\" and then his campaign said he was \"serious\"\n- accused Obama of being an ISIS sympathizer \n- suggested that Hillary Clinton is secretly ill, and lacks the \"mental and physical stamina\" to take on ISIS, perpetuating an alt-right conspirarcy theory that Clinton secretly suffers from a serious, chronic ailment \n- said that Putin wasn't in Crimea despite Russia invading Eastern Ukraine and maintaining a presence a few years earlier\n- lied about meeting Putin in Russia\n- called on Russian hackers to find Hillary Clinton's missing Secretary of State emails\n- said John McCain isn't a war hero \"because he was captured\"\n- accepted a Purple Heart from a veteran despite having been a draft-dodger\n- didn't know what the nuclear triad was\n- said women who get abortions should be punished\n- said Ghazala Khan didn't speak with her husband Khizr at the DNC because she \"wasn't allowed to\" (because of her Muslim faith), without any evidence\n- suggested that after the election, if Hillary Clinton wins, the \"second amendment\" people could take her out to prevent her from appointing pro-gun control SCOTUS judges (while he later \"clarified\" he was talking about having the gun lobby vote against Clinton this election cycle, many people, including in the audience, thought he implied violence against Clinton)\n- suggested that the Clintons could have murdered Vince Foster\n- said Clinton was responsible for the death of a nuclear scientist in Iran\n- speculated that Antonin Scalia was murdered \n- blamed terrorism for EgyptAir crash without any evidence at all\n- threatened to open up libel laws because of newspaper criticism against his campaign \n- asserted that the general election is inherently \"rigged,\" without any evidence \n- supported the spreading of nuclear weapons to other countries\n- praised the 1989 Tienanmen Square massacre in China\n- praised authoritarian dictators like Kim Jong-un, Putin, and Saddam Hussein \n- referred to 9/11 as \"7/11\"\n- semi-threatened the pope \n- threatened to withdraw from NATO\n\nIf someone genuinely supports Trump, in that they feel his stated policy proposals will genuinely improve America, and believe his talking points, and they aren't supporting him as a lesser-of-two-evils, I don't view them as smart or well-informed on politics. Trump is a serial conspiracy theorist. Trump has consistently demonstrated that he's plainly ignorant about basic public policy issues and basic political facts. He's a master at pushing emotional buttons, and his supporters aren't bright enough, educated enough, and informed enough to know he's a demagogue. \n\n\n\n",

            "selftext": "Hillary Clinton is actually an extremely strong candidate and would be doing just fine in a contest with any of the Republicans who ran this year, although her lead might be smaller. \n\nI will talk about her positives, then the GOP's negatives.\n\n**Firstly**, she has near universal name recognition and is attached to a popular former President. She was a politically active first lady, a reasonably well liked Senator, a very strong contender for the 2008 primary, and a Secretary of State. She has been in the national eye for 24 years and has been attached to two very popular Democratic presidents.\n\n**Secondly**, she has been in the national eye for so long that she can handle scrutiny exceptionally well. I'd say the biggest example of this is her keeping her cool during 11 hours of hearings about Benghazi, but she's been doing it since at least 1992.\n\n**Thirdly**, she, as part of the biggest power-couple in the world, also has an insane network of friends and talent in every level of government and among the best staffers as well. The Democratic Party leadership, specifically Obama, Reid, Pelosi, etc. dissuaded any other serious challengers. She also inherited the phenomenal campaign staff and infrastructure that Obama built during his runs. \n\n**Finally**, any Democrat has an baked in advantage simply due to the growing share of minorities, women, and young people in the electorate. Republicans have not made significant inroads with any of these demographics.\n\nOnto the Republicans:\n\nI will only cover the ones who received at least 1 delegate for simplicity's sake. I want to be clear that I believe every one of these candidates would be doing better than Trump in a general election, but I think they would still be losing vs. Hillary. \n\n* **Ted Cruz** is extremely far right and is too conservative for the general electorate. His greatest accomplishment is shutting down the government. He also has a very punchable face and gives off a sinister vibe, although I don't know the effect of this so I can concede this point. \n\n* **Marco Rubio** is the textbook definition of an empty suit, and he completely flopped under pressure from Christie during the debates (leading to the Rubio-bot meme). He was an absentee Senator and his biggest advantage - his support from Hispanics - is largely nixed because he backed out on his \"Gang of Eight\" immigration reform policy. \n\n* **Kasich** is a bit of a wildcard because he received such low support that he was never given any sort of scrutiny. However, I see no  reason to believe that he would do better with minorities, women, or young people than Mitt Romney did, which are the key demographics they need to win over in order to take 270 EV. \n\n* **Jeb Bush** is equally as uncharismatic as Hillary, but has his name attached to his brother's presidency and would be weighed down by that. Not to mention his policy proposals are as \"Generic Establishment Republican\" as they come, which would be used to attack him over and over. \n\n* **Rand Paul** is a libertarian nut and some of his positions (like his opposition to the Civil Rights Act on \"purely constitutional grounds\") would be battered over his head over and over.\n\nAnyway, CMV \n\n_____\n\n> *Hello, users of CMV!

            "selftext": "First of all, I don't actually approve of any of the candidates. Like most of the reddit hivemind I don't support Donald Trump or Hillary Clinton and none of the alternative party candidates appeal to me. I think Jill Stein is a loon and I don't approve of Gary Johnson's neoliberal economic policies so I don't want to throw my support that way.\n\nI don't think it really matters anyway. My state will go blue no matter my vote. Due to first-past-the-post and the electoral college, I believe the only reasonable thing for a single voter to do is to vote \"strategically\". The general strategy that is usually proposed is to vote with my heart if I'm not in a swing state/county, otherwise I must vote against the person I least want to win. Voting for anything other than one of the two big party candidates is really just a protest vote. I did this last time in 2012 but TBH, the whole thing feels like a waste of time and I believe my participation only serves to provide tacit approval of this farce.\n\nFinally, I think the entire process of voting for president is irrational to begin with. Even if somehow one of these alternate party candidates were to miraculously win, it would only serve to ensure more insanity and dysfunction in the Capitol. At that point, Jill Stein or Gary Johnson would be the _only_ member of their party in any federally elected position and they would most likely be fighting a losing battle against Republicans and Democrats in Congress. I think the process of majority party/coalition in Parliament selecting the head of state as they do in most other countries is just a more sensical system. The whole system seems broken to me.\n\nSo why bother? Honestly as I've gotten older my view of American politics has grown more and more cynical over the years and I think this may be my first step towards not voting anymore at all. I don't really believe my country is a functioning democracy anymore, but I hate being this cynical.

Conveniently, there just happens to be a group that hates the West as much as they do for what the West did to their families, full of resources to help the agenda of getting revenge on the West. Even if they weren't an innocent civilian, even if they were apart of ISIS and get bombed, their family is still going to feel hatred at something/anything even if they disagreed with their child/parent/siblings actions. In some cases, this may even be enough to push them over the edge and consider joining.\n\nIn my opinion, the U.S knows this, hence Trump wanting to get rid of everyone who follows the Muslim religion from American soil - just in case they suddenly have a family member obliterated as a mistake. A mistake that had been signed off by one, carried out by another, so the vengeance is pointed at the only face that will take ownership, the Western World. \n\nI don't have an alternative, as this is a war that the modern world just isn't prepared for. I can't even think of a peaceful way of ending the massacres, as the massacres are bringing peace to the people causing them, so why would stopping benefit them?\n\nTL;DR You can't shoot/bomb an ideology, and with guns/bombs seeming to be the only strategy the world has to offer, I don't see it to be possible to stop a group when their motivating force is something that can't be seen - let alone killed.\n\nCMV!\n\n\nEDIT: From my comment with the \u2206, \n\n> This definition has changed my mind. The organisation of ISIS can be defeated in the general sense of the word, and to see ISIS and the ideology of why they join as one of the same is naive. Not all people who are pissed at the West will join the organisation known as ISIS. They may still share the same view, but if the organisation itself ceases to exist, it has been defeated.\n\n[Permalink](https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/4y632h/cmv_isis_will_never_be_defeated_because_you_cant/d6mljxk)\n_____\n\n> *Hello, users of CMV!

            "selftext": "Boy, reddit will love me for this one.\n\nI'm specifically comparing FPTP voting to other methods which elect a single candidate (ie. not proportional representation).\n\nMy belief stems from the realization that any such system would lead, in the real world, to the same two-party system we have now. The reality is that, outside of the reddit bubble, the two-party system effectively represents a wide range of positions as well as any system can.\n\nPeople imagine that 'breaking the two-party monopoly' will lead to the election of Jill Stein or Ralph Nader. In reality, the mainstream candidates are mainstream for a reason - because they effectively represent the voters. If we have IRV, this race would still be between Clinton and Trump - Just with more distractions. \n\nThe one advantage of alternate systems that I do recognize is reducing the spoiler effect. However, our modern system has gotten pretty good at recognizing and 'eliminating' the spoiler effect, and alternate systems would reduce the stigma of spoilers - we would have more spoiler candidates who are less effective.\n\nThese small advantages, however, must be compared to the increased complexity of filling out ballots, which will eventually lead to many disqualified/unintended votes, especially with the more complex systems, and the 'gaming the system' which poses a big problem with systems like approval voting. **Edit** The most dangerous effect of this is a lack of transparency in the results. Look at the people complaining about delegate allocation for the Democratic primary. When the winner of the election is determined by anything more complex than adding up votes, people can't trust the result.\n\nEDIT: To be clear, I mean that a system with multiple left-wing or right-wing parties will never exist even without FPTP. Parties face other benefits from consolidating, such as preventing intra-coalition fighting and combining data/fundraisin\n_____\n\n> *Hello, users of CMV! This is a footnote from your moderators.

I think we are getting too polarized and we need to start looking for more moderate views between both sides. I think if it were implemented in this election, Gary might actually win over Trump and Hilary.\n\nI'm hoping that what will happen is that a large enough majority in the US will be fed up with the system after this vote because it's so polarized right now that people will ask for a better system, and given that this system produces better majority rule leaders, we'll see it be put up as a solution.\n\nI think it should be implemented and that it's the most likely outcome if we are going to change how things work.

            "selftext": "There do exist some policies which Trump proposes, which are arguably neither racist nor sexist (although I still disagree with them, and they are probably driven by latent bigotry). This includes trade protectionism and building a wall. \n\nHowever, there is no doubt in my mind that Trump himself is a racist (the comments on Judge Curiel and his comments on Muslim Americans are just two examples) and a [sexist](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/18-real-things-donald-trump-has-said-about-women_us_55d356a8e4b07addcb442023).\n\nWhen I meet people who support Trump, I perceive them as being okay with a racist and sexist individual being the President. That means they must be racist and sexist, to some degree, even if they support him for (what they claim are) legitimate policy reasons.\n\n_____\n\n> *Hello, users of CMV!

I'm glad that so many people gave their input, but none of it has really convinced me to change my mind, and most new replies are bringing up repeating points by now. Maybe patriotism just doesn't fit my way of thinking :/ Thanks for joining in\n\n---\n\nOriginal Post:\n\nI've never understood why I should support, celebrate, or agree with something just because of a shared nationality.\n\nOn the more \"harmless but useless\" side of the spectrum, sports(wo)men performing great feats, scientists making groundbreaking discoveries, and artists creating masterpieces, are all impressive regardless of the nationality. (Obviously, at this end, I don't *object* to others' national pride, i just don't feel the need for it personally)\n\nOn the more harmful side, this way of thinking, that \"the outsider\" is inferior, or less deserving of support, is the root of racism, sexism, homophobia, and led to the likes of Adolf Hitler, Nigel Farage, and Donald Trump rising in the political ranks, all of whom have based their political stances on the idea of maintaining national identity and superiority in the face of supposed adversity from \"the other\" (jews, immigrants, and muslims, respectively).\n\nOf course, there are examples in between these two, but i think just these two extremes illustrate my point well enough.\n\nWhat benefit is there to having a sense of patriotism or national identity - for oneself, or anyone else?\n\nCLARIFYING EDIT:\n\nI'm not saying National Pride is inherently bad 100% of the time, but i do believe the good side of it is entirely outdated, and we should focus instead on forwarding our advancement as a race, rather than limiting ourselves to mere nations. Should we not ALL be proud of Bolt's speed, or Ledecky's swimming prowess? Should we not ALL be excited that Hawking is among us and making such great advancements in physics?\n\n_____\n\n> *Hello, users of CMV! This is a footnote from your moderators.

            "selftext": "(when i say america, i mean the USA)\n\nBy ruin, i mean:\n\nDonald Trump is actively promoting policies that will:\n\n1. Ruin America's standing as the worlds economic leader.\n\n2. Ruin America's ability to influence policy around the globe.\n\n3. Get rid of whatever respect western Europe has for America.\n\nThe argument's I i have that I feel defend these statements are:\n\n1. He is suggesting ending significant free agreements, despite the large agreements by economists, (77% of NABE economists think the TTP should either be accepted (47%) or renegotiated (30%)), trumps push to end nafta, kill the ttp, and impose massive tarrifs seem to be widely viewed by economists to be damageing to the US economy. Why anyone would so storngly reject economists consensus, unless they wanted to hurt the economy, makes little sense to me, so i understand his trade policy as desiring to hurt our economy. \n\nAdditionally, trump appears to want to massively increase the debt, his first tax policy (and other policies) would increase the debt by close to 11 trillion dollars over 10 years, when compared to Hillary's policies or current policy. His new one is slightly better, I haven't found any quality evaluations of it though. even if it was only 5 trillion worse than hillary's that would still massively increase the debt to a point where its bad. I am not the best educated on how high the debt can go, but a debt of 34 to 39 trillion dollars seems a bit excessive. The only reasons i could understand wanting a debt that high, given the ease with which America could have a debt closer to 28 trillion, is either from a desire to hurt America, or a desire to help ones self (by reducing ones own taxes as low as possible). However, his tax proposal isnt as low as he can make it for himself, so i am not confident that the latter option is true.\n\n2. A significant part of America's ability to influence global policy comes from our status as providing a nuclear umbrella to many countries. Trump has proposed ending that, and allowing Japan, Saudi Arabia, and South Korea to develop nuclear weapons. This would severely limit our ability to influence those countries foreign policies, as they would no longer require our support to ensure MAD stays true with regards to, say, North Korea. Japan and South Korea would be far more free to act contrary to our wishes, and could start wars without our permission, and our ability to stop them would be severely limited to non-military means. Saudi Arabia is a horrific country, allowing them to develop nuclear weapons would pretty much lead to that kingdom being able to ignore us entirely (which it is close to already, because of the massive power of their oil). The justifications trump gave for allowing this to happen (countering Iranian, North Korean, and Chinese aggression) are completely ridiculous, because our nuclear arsenal is already capable of doing those things to the fullest extent a nuclear arsenal can. The only \"benefit\" we get out of this is that Japan, South Korea, and Saudi Arabia can more freely act against our wishes. That is only a \"benefit\" if your goal is to ruin Americas ability to influence policy around the globe. \n\nAdditionally, his economic policies (refinancing the debt, reducing free trade) seem likely to promote the reduction of the use of american dollars as reserve currency. I feel that USD as reserve currency gives us some power over the countries that use it because of the degree to which our monetary policy effects them. A reduction in that would hurt our ability to influence policy.\n\n\n3. Trump is A) ridiculous at speaking, \"I know words, I have the best words\" etc is embarrassing. Trumps status as a UPenn grad make me believe that he is a far more capable speaker than quotes like that make him appear. However, the sheer commonality of those quotes is unbelievable. Obama had occasional slips of the tongue, bush did too, however the quotes from trump are far less understandable or acceptable, and appear intentional. Whatever quotes make it across Atlantic must make him look idiotic. Additionally, revelations about gitmo and our spying programs have hurt America's image in Europe, trump is in favor of both things. Lastly, his ties to russia/approval of russia must make our NATO allies rather awkward\n\n\n\n\nhttp://files.constantcontact.com/668faa28001/5ac72447-7e42-4a38-90d7-baf2872d0755.pdf?ver=1471625888000 \n\nhttp://crfb.org/blogs/how-much-would-clinton-and-trump-increase-our-19-trillion-gross-debt\n\nhttp://www.breitbart.com/video/2016/03/29/trump-i-hate-proliferation-but-it-would-be-better-if-japan-saudi-arabia-and-south-korea-had-nuclear-weapons/\n_____\n\n> *Hello, users of CMV!

Trump's plan includes three major reasons why it will actually increase tax revenue (and no, I'm not going to point to the potential economic growth). \n\nThe first reason is the removal of almost all tax deductions for the highest bracket. This is a huge and easily exploited loophole for the ultra rich. Any seasoned accountant can find a number of deductions for you to use. \n\nThe second reason is the removal of other loopholes like the carried interest loophole, which is the one most favored by Buffett and Romney. \n\nThe third reason is that it remove corporate deferrals of foreign profits. There is $2.1 trillion being held overseas. They can repatriate that money at a discounted 10%, and all future profits will be taxed here regardless of where they wind up. \n\nEven though the tax bracket would be 33%, the removal of almost all loopholes would make it so the effective tax rate is actually near or at 33%. \n\nThe corporate tax at only 15% would actually tax all profits generated by corporations, and it would mean that effective tax rate would be actually near or at 15%.\n\nIt makes the tax revenue our country collects much closer to what it is supposed to be. With our current loopholes, we could say the highest tax bracket is 90%, and I'm sure Buffett and Romney, amongst others, would still only pay an effective rate under 20%.\n\nIt doesn't take a rocket scientist to see why Romney and his Goldman Sachs buddies are so avidly against Trump and why Bloomberg has also thrown his weight around too. It helps remove some of the burden of the middle and working classes at the expense of more of the billionaires paying their fair share.",

Despite her many controversies over the past few years and especially over the last few months the fact is she is still very much of Donald Trump in the vast majority of national polls (even though that does not really matter because of the electoral college) she is still winning in Florida (+4), Pennsylvania (+5.4), Ohio (+3.3), Colorado(+3.9), Virginia (+5.5),and losing by a very small margin to Trump in Georgia (-1.6) and this may not seem like much but when compared to the polls of 2012 you can really see how shocking this is, Obama was up in all of those states (except Georgia) but the margins are completely different Florida (+0.5)(he ended up losing this state anyway), Pennsylvania (+3.8), Ohio (+2.9), Colorado (+1.5), Virginia (+0.3) and the most drastic change by far Georgia (-10.0) and to make matters worse for Georgia republicans is that there was very little ad before Clinton was seen as a remote possibility, but I only assume that can and will change or already has. based on these statistics here I am convinced (But not without an open mind) that Hillary Clinton will win the 2016 presidential election.   \n\nsorry for the spelling in advance this is the longest post I have made thus far. \n\nlink to a map I made on the great website 271 to win: http://www.270towin.com/maps/Ppg77 \nsource for most of my poll findings: http://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/2016-election-forecast/ \nsource for the 2012 polls of major swing states in 2012: http://www.politico.com/2012-election/swing-state/",

            "selftext": "I believe that anything that's out of a person's control should not influence our assessment of how good of a person he or she is. A trivial example would be a crime that happens in some other part of the world and to all intends and purposes cannot be influenced by you; the fact that this crime is being committed doesn't make you a bad person. I assume that most people would agree with this.\n\nThe principle is also applicable the other way around. If mere circumstances prevented *you* from committing a crime, then that's a stain on your personality, since you are susceptible to committing a crime, and the only factor that stopped you from doing so was out of your control.\n\nTherefore I am right in having an opinion about you that is similar to the opinion I have of some criminal, if I am convinced that you would have committed the same crime under given circumstances.\n\nIf you swapped a person living in the 21st century with someone from 1930s Germany, chances are they will take part in the crimes that were committed during those years. Therefore, if I am convinced that that would be the case, I am right in viewing that person the same way I view a 1930s Nazi. Looking at what's going on with right-wing authoritarian forces in the world right now ([AfD](http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/german-police-should-shoot-refugees-says-german-party-leader-a6844611.html), [Front National](https://www.euractiv.com/section/eu-elections-2014/news/french-national-front-plagued-by-anti-semitism/), [Turkey and Erdogan](http://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-37003819), [Trump](http://edition.cnn.com/2015/12/02/politics/donald-trump-terrorists-families/), etc) I believe that a significant amount at least of those groups would act similar to some of 1930s Germans.\n\nThis principle has practical implications with respect to police work. In our current system circumstances are a necessary condition to punish someone (someone who is never under given circumstances would never commit a crime and therefore would never be punished). I believe that the police should create such circumstances on a reasonable level while also being there to prevent any damage and take the criminals into custody (as is being done with child pornography), both for a moral reason and to prevent possible crimes from happening in the future. This should of course try to intervene with people's lives as little as possible. I am not entirely certain whether this is feasible from a practical standpoint.\n\nYou can change my view for example by pointing out that most of the people I cited with respect to Nazi Germany would actually not take part in a Nazi regime, or by pointing out that personality itself is a product of circumstances (i.e. free will doesn't exist), or by pointing out that described preemptive measures by the police are not practicable. \n\n\n\n\n_____\n\n> *Hello, users of CMV!

Scientific progress is very important to me, but I feel like I am being internally inconsistent by supporting cuts to military spending, privatization of social security/safety net stuff, etc. The only other thing I would want government to spend more on is (off the top of my head) roads, trains, and other infrastructure. But even that I would prefer spearheaded by state governments with only a few big changes made by the federal system.\n\nI am particularly interested in hearing viewpoints that make the case that scientific progress will do just fine/even better without federal involvement (e.g. left to private universities and companies or bored rich dudes like Elon Musk).\n\nAs random background, I've been left of center pretty much my entire adult life. Through this election I have been reexamining many of my ideas and listening to other viewpoints more and have drifted more toward the middle on many issues. I plan to vote for Gary Johnson (only because Trump is definitely going to win my state (LA) so voting for Clinton would equally be a waste, and I like Johnson slightly more).\n_____\n\n> *Hello, users of CMV!

            "selftext": "First thing, \"Mexico will pay for the wall\" is just obviously ridiculous, because (1) why would Mexico build something for the US, and (2) Mexico has said numerous times it will not. But this CMV is **not** limited to that. I read Trump's [actual plan](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/positions/pay-for-the-wall) on this, and my criticism is about that. His actual plan has more substance than the slogan he repeats at his rallys, but it's still nonsensical as I will now argue.\n\nBasically, Trump's detailed plan as in that link boils down to putting pressure on Mexico, threatening them with something worse than paying for the wall, such as\n\n * Stopping remittances from the US to Mexico (i.e., prevent people in the US from sending money back to their families in Mexico).\n * Imposing trade tariffs.\n * Canceling visas or charging for visas.\n\nAll of which he says are sources of revenue **greater** than what the wall would cost. Hence Mexico would prefer to pay for the wall instead, rationally speaking.\n\nThe **first** reason all of this is ridiculous is the obvious one: if those things are worth more than the wall costs, and are actually viable options legally, practically, and morally (without which they are not viable threats) then isn't the better deal for the US to do them? That is, if we can get more money than the cost of the wall by doing them, why wouldn't we do them, build the wall, and have money left over for other things? If instead we get Mexico to pay for the wall then we lose money and only gain that it \"sounds\" nice to the public in that we can say Mexico is paying for it. But that's not a good deal.\n\nThe **second** reason is that those threats are not viable legally, practically, and/or morally. First, Mexico is a close ally with a major land border with the US. Bullying it with threats is just not a good idea. Second, the downsides for the US of those options could be significant, for example canceling visas or charging for them or preventing remittances would mean far fewer workers enter the US from Mexico, affecting many industries. Third, it's not clear that preventing remittances would be legal ([globally they are, and are a very large stream of capital](http://www.migrationpolicy.org/programs/data-hub/global-remittances-guide)), which could be a costly battle; and even if preventing such bank transfers were legal, it just means that the transfer would go underground, i.e., be handled illegally by money launderers or physical transfer, to the benefit of criminals. Finally, imposing trade tariffs unilaterally on a major ally sends a very dangerous signal to other allies, potentially causing more trade conflicts.\n\nAll of that stuff is really just the fact that there are good reasons we haven't done those things Trump is saying we should threaten Mexico with. They don't make sense to do, and therefore they don't make sense to threaten with.\n\n**edit**: To clarify, I'm talking about the \"make Mexico pay for the wall\" plan, not the \"get Trump elected\" plan. If you think \"make Mexico pay for the wall\" is just a cynical plot to get votes, then that tactic might or might not make sense in a way, but it's not what I'm talking about. As I went into detail above, my view in this CMV is about the **actual content** of Trump's \"make Mexico pay for the wall\" plan not making sense.\n\n_____\n\n> *Hello, users of CMV!

I perceive Bush to have been handled by the party into the war in the Middle East, which had enough short-term gains for invested businesses to offset the long-term damage to the economy.* He is actually easier to deal with as President than as candidate because as President he loses the protection of his voters and the media, and can be impeached (which would be great for ratings).\n\nThe greatest danger a Trump presidency presents would be for Trump to win, and then bring all of his madness (speaking from the progressive side) to a halt and let the Karl Roves of the party install, for example, a hardliner on the Supreme Court. If Trump's circus were allowed to become a reality it would be a (further) disaster for the GOP and a disaster for domestic and foreign trade, and the actual powers-that-be won't condone it. If he wins, he'll either be quickly impeached or he'll reverse his platform and become a generic Republican player to survive in office.\n\nEither way his personality's net effect (with the exception of the Supreme Court scenario) will be minimal. I believe that Hillary Clinton is loathed enough in the US for voters to put Trump in as a \"Never Hillary\" gesture. I don't believe that mainstream America (and its attendant corporate handlers) is actually Glenn Beck enough to tolerate a Trump administration as it's been pitched so far. I only worry about Trump sticking in it long enough to win, and then let himself be manipulated into filling a SCOTUS seat with long-term damaging effects.

Going over the top-level comments so far there are valid points against the precedent of any candidate winning on fear-/hate-mongering, and I agree that anti-minority rhetoric coming out of the White House poses a real danger to citizens as instigation to violence. \u2206\n\n**edit 2:** Thanks to all commenters so far. I can see my perspective was too narrow on damage that can be done by executive orders, cabinet appointments & the possibility of a Pence administration succeeding an impeached Trump.\n\n**edit 3:** And on damage to climate change progress.\n_____\n\n> *Hello, users of CMV!

            "selftext": "First, let me clarify that I mean this literally. I'm not a Trump supporter at all, I think him and his movement represent everything wrong with America. I think he's a demagogue who garners his support on a purely emotional basis, appealing to people's anger and fear while confirming their (at many times racist) perceptions that Mexicans, Muslims, the Chinese, and everyone in between are destroying the country. If he wins (which right now is not likely, but still very possible), it would be very, very bad. A lot of people will feel unsafe, unwelcome, and most importantly, scared. Their leader, the person who is supposed to provide the country guidance and support, will be somebody who does not have their best interests at heart and will throw them under the bus as long as it makes him more popular with his fans. Internationally, there could be a variety of reactions. People may distance themselves from America. Some may condemn Trump and say we made a mistake. Some may want nothing to do with us anymore. Others could not care at all. But it would in general put us on a very bad standing with the rest of the world, both in how governments and their citizens view us. In short, a Trump presidency would be a disaster.\n\nBut it wouldn't destroy the country. After his 4 years, there will still be an election. There will still be Congress. There will still be the Constitution. We've had plenty of other disastrous presidents and we've survived them. Maybe we didn't come out stronger on the other side, but the country was far from destroyed. I get that Trump is different. But the office of President isn't. There are still limitations, there are still checks and balances, there are still impeachments, and there are still re-election campaigns and term limits. Part of the genius of America is that a President can't make major change by himself. FDR had Congress and the Court on his side. Same with LBJ, and Reagan, and Clinton. They all had to work with the rest of the government. And Trump does not have a good relationship with the rest of the government. Many congressional Republicans refuse to support him, and most of the ones who do do so reluctantly. And what's more, the Democrats have a very good chance at taking the Senate. While I don't think they'll be as obstructionist as the Republicans now, they still wouldn't dare to pass any major aspects of Trump's agenda. He will need to negotiate with them, and from there they will be able to soften many of his proposals. An example is the wall. A blue Senate will not pass a bill to build a gigantic wall along the entirety of our southern border. But if they had to pass something, they would perhaps only decide to build a wall in areas with high drug traffic, or they'd put more resources into vetting immigrants and deporting the illegal ones who commit crimes. And the Supreme Court would strike down many of his ideas as unconstitutional, chief among them the Muslim ban. And even if he does get to make appointments, I think he'd be hard-pressed to find a justice qualified for SCOTUS who would be on board with his agenda, and even if he does, that Democratic Senate can find some reason to reject the nomination. And even if there isn't a blue Senate, it's still most likely gonna be very narrow at the election's end. A near-majority of Democrats plus a few never-Trump Republicans creates a working anti-Trump majority. \n\nTl;dr: Trump alone doesn't have the power to do all the things he says he'll do. He needs to work with the government, and many in the government wholeheartedly refuse to subscribe to his agenda.",

            "selftext": "Just to be clear, Im not a Trump supporter. I am just talking about strategy.\n\nI think Donald Trump should outright refuse to participate in the debates unless Jill Stein and Gary Johnson are also included. My logic is simple, Donald Trump would benefit because of the following reasons:\n\n(1) he does better in polls when Johnson and Stein are also included, and the more chaos there is this election, the better chance he has to win,\n\n(2) he would speak for less time, making him less likely to make a total and complete ass of himself,\n\n(3) he would get the benefit of other people hating on HRC, since Johnson and Stein would likely attack the frontrunner (plus, she has policies to attack, he doesn't know anything, so it makes the people attacking her seem more grounded in policy if they do it legitimately),\n\n(4) he could use the advocacy of Stein and Johnson as the (legitimate) basis for a claim the system is corrupt, saying it's not a real democracy unless more voices are included,\n\n(5) Trump's only real path to victory is to get a significant portion of the independent vote, what better way to get credibility with independents than to give the third party candidates a platform,\n\n(6) he claims he wants to shake up the system, here is his best chance to prove he is not just hot air,\n\n(7) he hates the Republican party as much as anyone, so fuck them for rigging the system with the dems to keep the third parties out.\n\n(8) it couldn't possibly harm him, considering he is going lose if he doesn't.\nChange my view. why would it be bad for Trump to refuse to debate with HRC unless the third party candidates were also included.\n_____\n\n> *Hello, users of CMV!

            "selftext": "I sincerely want someone to change my view here because I feel like I'm stuck between a rock and a hard place. On one side, I hate the idea of Clinton winning after all the bullshit the DNC pulled to sabotage Sanders and the corruption Clinton represents. I personally believe corruption is the worst characteristic of politicians even more than bigotry and racism because at least you can see the bigotry and racism and attack it directly but you can't attack corruption because it takes place behind closed doors and it just rots society from the inside out. \n\nThat being said, every time I start to warm up to the idea of Trump winning I just need to hear a Trump supporter speak and I lose complete faith in humanity. They just come across as the worst kind of people and I'd hate for such a large group of people I dislike to win anything. \n\nFor example, I feel they are such hypocrites. They are the loudest to cry about free speech and make a fuss when Reddit or a university campus tries to punish them for being politically incorrect yet here they are [supporting a boycott of kaepernick](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskTrumpSupporters/comments/52gln3/does_trump_support_the_right_of_nfl_players_to/) for exercising his right to free speech. How is ruining someone's career for practicing free speech any different than expelling a student for supporting Trump on campus or Reddit blocking anti-Hillary news articles? Disagreeing with someone is one thing but ruining someone's career is just away to suppress their opinion. \n\nThey are very immature. /r/the_donald is like a highschool forum. How can self-respecting adults act like the way they do? I get that it's a just a sub for Trump supporters to have fun but that's no excuse. I'm 29 years old, an independent adult and I try to conduct myself in such a way that reflects that. Sure, I'd love to just let go of all inhibition and play video games all day and act like a little kid but I don't because I don't live with my parents anymore and I have to act responsibly. Just like I don't support my presidential candidate by spreading stupid photos of a frog and dumb buzz words. If you ever visited the /r/Sandersforpresident sub you'd notice it was %95 intelligent productive discussion and %5 shit posting. That pretty much goes for any sub filled with mature minded people. Unfortunately, Trump supporters don't feel the ethical obligation to conduct themselves with dignity when supporting their candidate and I find this troubling. \n\nThey are racist. I'm referring to their obsession with the word **cuck**. I'm sure there are many other cases but this seems to be one of the most blatant. Incase you are unaware, cuck used to be most commonly used in porn and still is to denote white men letting black screw their wives. This correlates with their obsession with white guilt in which they insinuate that liberals will allow 3rd world immigrants to infiltrate their country and rape their women simply due to white guilt. It's a racist term they try to hide under the dictionary definition of the word. I'm not buying it. They keep adopting these extremely racist buzzwords and then claiming ignorance when called out on it. Like the (((echoes))) and affiliation with the alt-right who are openly white nationalist. To me this screams of deception. If Trump wins these people will go full Nazi. If they are doing this kind of shit whilst trying to promote their candidate imagine what they'll do when he wins. They'll probably start waving Nazi flags and claiming it represents the original swastika of the Hindus which represented peace. \n\n\n\n_____\n\n> *Hello, users of CMV!

            "selftext": "\"Make America Great Again\" is a regressive and absurd motto spouted by the least qualified presidential nominee in American history.\n\nWhen Trump uses the term \"Make American Great Again,\" to when is he referring? When was America great if it isn't now? How exactly does he *plan* to make a nation of 325 million people uniformly \"great\"?\n\nIt seems Trump supporters want to revert to the 1950s, which *were*, in some ways, \"great\" times for America. We were riding a collective high after World War 2, and the economy was booming. But even though some look back on the 1950s as a time of strong \"family values,\" people seem to forget that there were horrible things happening beneath that squeaky clean facade, e.g. the Korean War, McCarthyism, the Cold War, and rampant segregation.\n\nAmerica as a nation has continued to progress since then. Gay marriage is legal. Racism, though certainly far from abated, is less accepted and institutionalized than it once was. There are racists of course, as there always will be (ironically, many of Trump's supporters and Trump himself), but it is now the consensus opinion that racism is wrong, whereas 50 years ago that was not the case. We are trending *away* from racism, though the prevalence of social media has led some to believe otherwise. \n\nWe are also [trending away from violence](http://www.nationalreview.com/corner/427758/careful-panic-violent-crime-and-gun-crime-are-both-dropping-charles-c-w-cooke), though Trump would like his supporters to believe we're in a state of chaos. There seems to be a consensus amongst Trump supporters that we are in need of a drastic change, but that's simply not the case. The unemployment rate is sub-5%. Yes, there are problems with our country, but there are problems with *every* country. Relative to the rest of the world, America *is* great, and the solutions to many of its problems are the antithesis of what Trump's preaching. Brute force and a constant opposition to \"the other\" are not what our nation needs.\n\nAmerica is far too big and varied to be uniformly *anything*. There are problems, but many of those problems are basic human problems. We will never fully oust gun violence, racism, etc. but most of these issues are *trending downward* despite the media circus surrounding them.\n\nMake America Great *Again* though literally every decade has had a whole host of problems? Isn't it almost logical that we have progressed positively over time? In many, many ways, we have. Just because there is no longer the facade of Leave-It-To-Beaver family values does *not* mean that we are in anyway morally bankrupt, hurting, or in need of drastic change.\n\nThere are 196 countries in the world, and America is *easily* in the top ten or so of those to live in, not to mention being likely the most influential and powerful nation.\n\nIs Make America Great Again nothing more than a thinly veiled desire to revert to the uber-white moral absolutism of the 1950s? Seems like it to me.\n\n_____\n\n> *Hello, users of CMV! This is a footnote from your moderators. We'd just like to remind you of a couple of things.

            "selftext": "I can see why people would excuse voting for a man with a long history of racism. I can excuse people for supporting a man who has chosen a homophobe for vice president. I can understand why people would get behind a man who constantly judges women based on their appearances and mocks disabled reporters.\n\nWhat I can't understand is why people would vote for a man who has shown such ignorance, lack of scientific knowledge and downright stupidity.\n\nHere are a few examples of what I'm talking about, with the most revealing in bold:\n\n* **He's a climate change denier**\n\n* He's an anti-vaxxer\n\n* He thinks that the link between cancer and asbestos is a conspiracy\n\n* He thinks that environmentally friendly light bulbs cause cancer\n\n* He speaks with the vocabulary of a 3^rd grader\n\n* **He believes that we can fix the economy by just printing more money** (a tactic that did wonders for Weimar Germany)\n\n* He shows an extremely limited knowledge of current affairs (e.g. when he said that Putin wasn't in Crimea)\n\n* And, most importantly, he **\"echoes the words of whomever last spoke to him\"** (in the words of the Trump campaign)\n\nAll of these are telltale signs of an extremely ignorant and unintelligent man, (which one would assume aren't exactly great things to be if you're running a country)\n\n^(N.B. I am asking if anyone could convince me that Donald is, in fact, intelligent, or just not stupid.

            "selftext": "I have three primary reasons for this:\n\nThe leader of the free world should not be ignorant.  I respect his stance of non-interventionism.  A lot of troubles happening around the world are due to American meddling.  It'll take a strong, principled man not to intervene in genocides, dictators slaughtering their own people, and the subsequent international condemnation for not acting.  However, ignorance is inexcusable.  If you're condemning 300,000 civilians to die of starvation in Aleppo through your inaction, I want you to understand the gravity of the decision.  Principled non-interventionism is a stance, being an idiot running for the White House is not.  (Also, the siege of Aleppo might be relieved if the ceasefire holds and aid can make it past government troops.  I doubt Gary Johnson knows that fact before the Aleppo fiasco.) \n\nSecondly, the President should be aware of current events.  Aleppo was making the headlines especially that week. as the situation there worsened.  If Gary Johnson blanked on that question, then he has not been paying attention to the news for 5 minutes or his staffers have not.  A president needs to maintain awareness of both the greatest global threats to America and the greatest global crises at all times.  I hope it's not too difficult to ask Gary Johnson to watch the news or be informed by his staffers.\n\nThirdly, since the President acts as the face of the Government to both its people and to nations abroad, a President needs to act \"presidential\" and project confidence and respect at all times.  Even if the first two reasons were excusable for some reason, there are much softer ways of asking for clarification rather than \"What is Aleppo?\".  Either he is not mentally 100% when he needs to be at an interview, or he just plain lacks personal charisma.  I wished I lived in a world where it didn't matter how you say things and people don't judge you for your flubs, but unfortunately we live in the real world and a world where the President has to interact with world leaders, other human beings, and the media.  Gary is running for the most difficult job in the world, and Gary if elected will have to project strength and confidence for the duration of his Presidency.\n\nFor the above reasons, I currently lump Gary Johnson into the same category as Donald Trump and Jill Stein as another incompetent running for the White House.  I created this post on CMV to see if I am missing anything or are the any arguments that would uncategorize him as \"ignorant and incompetent\".\n\nAlso, on a slightly related note, I am disgusted with many Redditors attempting to excuse Gary's ignorance with their own.  Reddit mocks the creationists, anti-climate change, and anti-vaccines on a constant basis.  But excusing the pivotal battlefield of Syria?  My mind boggles.  Educated electorate, they are not.\n\nSo please, attempt to change my mind.\n_____\n\n> *Hello, users of CMV! This is a footnote from your moderators.

Here's why:\n\nI think a Trump presidency would be a wake-up call for the US and show the average American that a functioning democracy requires citizens who engage with their government.  It would put America's bigotry and racism center-stage and force us to actually confront it rather than our media's current baby-gloves approach.  I believe Trump would be a completely ineffective president kept in such tight check by the Congress, Courts, and Media that his potential to cause harm would be extremely limited.\n\nAlso, not electing Clinton would show the Democratic Party that just because they are the only party with reasonable stances on social issues, they cannot elect a blatantly corrupt politician to the office of President.  I believe we would see the Dems put up better candidates in the future.\n\nWhile I am seriously concerned about the kinds of Supreme Court Justices we would see Trump nominate, I'm fairly confident that the Congress would be able to weed out the extremists and temper the lasting effects of Trump in the White House.\n\nPlease, someone, CMV.\n\nedit: Thanks for the responses everyone.  I'll be voting for Hillary in November to put my support behind the Democratic Party platform. \n\nMost of you would be well-served by being less condescending.

An era of rebirth. \n\nInstead, in the face of imminent victory, all we seem to feel is faux cheerfulness at best and at worst... despair. \n\n\nHow did it get this way?\n\nIt's my contention that the Democratic Party's current shift from the triumph of the Obama election to the apathy and disaffection of the Clinton campaign is not actually very surprising, or undeserved, but the natural by-product of throwing the values of the party by the wayside.\n\n\nWhen Obama was elected, that was great, but the Democrats, so used to failure and so excited at this rare victory, rested on their laurels rather than acting on their beliefs. There was no attempt to hold anyone accountable for the wars on false premises. There was no attempt to hold anyone accountable for torture, or secret hidden prisons, or illegal executions-without-trial via drone strike, or unjustified civilian deaths. And that was just the war. There was no attempt to bring anyone to justice over the financial disaster of 2008 -- the largest crash since the Great Depression. When leaks of massive illegal secret government surveillance were made public, no-one was held accountable. In fact, the Obama government seemed to care far, far more about the crimes that were necessary to leak the information than they ever would about the 1984 stuff. I'm not talking about failures of justice here. I'm talking about failures to even try to do anything that resembled justice on any of these crucial violations. These horrible power abuses, which cried out for the rule of decent law were just... forgotten. Left aside. Dumped. \n\n\nNone of that would have really mattered, except for the 2016 nomination. Bernie vs Hillary, right? Instead of introducing a reasonable array of candidates, including a high-flying former SoS, the election was basically a pit match between Bernie \"the Unelectable Ancient Millennial Mascot\" Sanders and Hillary \"You Know They Wouldn't Actually Let Her Lose\" Clinton.\n\nBut fine, fine. So the Democrats unified. That's good, right?\n\n\nNo. It revealed an increasingly dangerous and toxic culture. The Democrats were taking on an odd mix of entitlement and desperation. When the stuff came out about the email, they basically ignored it. She wasn't going to get indicted anyway, really -- at the end of the day, we all know she's above the law. When it became clear that she \"misled,\" time and again, the FBI of the government she intended to lead, it was basically ignored. Yes, Hillary knew that she was above the law. Yes, she knew that against Trump, all would be forgiven. And she acted on that knowledge, and enjoyed the benefits of being corrupt and powerful in the US. This made a highly public farce of the justice system and put American hypocrisy on display for the entire world to see. And still, when the Democrats were faced with a symbol of all the hypocrisy and elitism they're supposed to be against more than anything... she just had to be elected!!\n\n\nSanders supporters were shamed. Prominent issues, like government abuse, were quieted and went unaddressed. When the Snowden case came up again and the President was asked to issue a pardon... no, of course not. That might hurt her chances. Winning comes before justice now, just like in the GOP. \n\n\nIf Clinton wins, it will re-affirm everything she believes. She is above the law. The law only applies to us little people, and all of us know it. The progessive Sanders people would be tied to a party that would spin increasingly right. The party would become pro-War, pro-spying: in other wars, it would be clear that justice would have no place. The Democrats would be -- and be seen to be -- symbols of despotism, hypocrisy, and corruption. A GOP purged of Trump would crucify them and their absurdly unpopular Madam President. The first woman President would be remembered, not as a heroic icon, but of a dishonest old lady. All that the great twentieth century Democrats built would be lost. \n\n\nTrump, on the other hand, would deliver the kind of shock America needs. His election would not just re-invigorate the political progress: it would wake it up with an airhorn. America would be wide awake, and deadly serious, and get a hard but necessary lesson: never let the demagogues win. The Democrats would get their lesson, too: this is what happens when you leave your principles behind. You lose everything. With the Hillary fever broken, the opposition Democrats could re-affirm their principles and stand up to Trump. The wildly unpopular orange tyrant would be contrasted with a reformed and caring Democratic Party, and the glorious victory that should have been in 2016 would be pushed back a few years, to 2020. And we would learn. \n\n\n**No tl;dr, sorry. The message is simply too big.** \n\n**Edit: downvote for quality, not for disagreement, please please please! Using downvotes as a disagree button makes this entire subreddit more of a circlejerk of popular ideas and less of a place to air new opinions!!!!**\n\n**Edit 2: I have to go for maybe an hour and a half, but *thank you* for your responses so far, and I look forward to continued discussion when I get back on!**\n\n**Edit 3: Okay, what the actual fuck is up with people downvoting my opinions. I have been reasonable, timely, and clear. This kind of downvoting is exactly the sort of thing that kills difference of opinion and makes Reddit worse. Nothing could make less sense in a subreddit specifically about different views. No offense, but if you do this fuck you.**\n\n\nWhat do you think, guys? I'm genuinely open-minded, but I also believe this strongly. Change my view!\n",

If your parents identify as Muslim then by the laws of most Muslim countries, you shall identify as Muslim as well. This form of identification will cause many people who have legal identities of Muslim though are not Muslim by personal belief to be unjustly banned from the United States. This is further worsened by the fact that most Muslim countries have severe consequences for those who try to convert from the Muslim religion. Consequences such as:\n\n* If you are married to a Muslim woman then your marriage can be forcibly dissolved\n\n* You can lose custody of your children\n\n* You can be executed\n \n* Countries such as Egypt will refuse to give an identification that states your new religion, thus dooming a person born a Muslim to be stuck with the identification for life.\n[Source of information](https://www.quora.com/Religious-Conversion-Do-Muslims-convert-to-other-religions-What-are-the-statistics)\n\nThese consequences make it near impossible for people in a Muslim country to convert to another religion even if they do not believe in Islam and will leave people unjustly banned from entering the United States.\n\nThis will cause massive uproar in countries where there are severe consequences for converting out of Islam and as it is, [Racial discrimination by a country is illegal as per the International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination](http://www.ohchr.org/EN/ProfessionalInterest/Pages/CERD.aspx)\n\nThe United States is a world superpower and must make its decisions while taking into account the consequences it will have in countries outside of itself.

Even in swing states.\n\n(3) I don't think that pollsters have the ability to accurately measure a huge increase in voters who have either never voted or have not voted in decades.\n\nTherefore I think Trump will win. Obviously I want to make the most money here, so if someone changes my mind I will Cash Out.\n\n_____\n\n> *Hello, users of CMV! This is a footnote from your moderators.

But that's not what this view is about.\n\nSuppose, hypothetically, that we *were* in fact going to build a wall. I posit that simply digging a trench would be more efficient and more effective. \n\nThe border wall has been estimated (by Trump) to cost $12b but independent analyses put it at higher than $20b. I can't imagine that digging a hole would cost more.\n\nTo get over a 35' wall is the same as to get over the 35' sidewall of the trench. It could be wide enough to prevent direct crossing and still be cheaper I believe. \n\nAs a bonus you could pile the dirt along the side, thus forming an even larger barrier. \n\nHowever, uneducated as I am in this field, I throw this out to CMV because I genuinely want to be able to say that I'm smarter than Trump. \n\n_____\n\n> *Hello, users of CMV!

My reasoning for this view is simply because every time the election comes around, the same old is said. \"This is the worst election ever.\" \"X will ruin our country!

            "selftext": "The notion that we need to get money out of politics is a popular one, increasingly supported by citizens of many political views. All 4 [major](http://www.ontheissues.org/2016/Gary_Johnson_Government_Reform.htm) [candidates](http://thehill.com/blogs/ballot-box/presidential-races/266189-trump-open-to-campaign-finance-reform) [for](http://ivn.us/2016/08/12/issues-candidate-stands-campaign-finance/) [President](http://www.theepochtimes.com/n3/2128180-clinton-vows-to-get-money-out-of-politics/) this year have endorsed some form of campaign finance reform aimed at making elections more honest/fair^1 . It's an issue I've been thinking on and following for a good 10 years now, and I think I've got a good plan, one that hasn't really been discussed at all, and seems to address lots of the issues, and get around many of the objections. \n\n* We institute a tax on political spending, any donation, or in the case of \"soft money\" direct spending in the form of ad buys, or even labor costs for phone bankers or door knockers.  \n* It's progressive on the individuals and institutions with at these rates.  \n * $0 : -$50 (edit from 500, which u/huadpe pointed out is too expensive) \n * $50-$1,000 : 10%  \n * $1,000 - $10,000 : 20%  \n * $10,000 - $50,000 : 30%  \n * $50,000 - $250,000 : 40%  \n * $250,000 -  : 50%\n  \n\n* Notice the $0 : -$50, this means everyone who can legally vote can spend up to $50 on political speech,in the form of donations to campaigns (personal OR issue based) and possibly other political expenditures.     \n* EDIT* possibly just set the voucher amount at some reasonable fraction of the money collected last cycle from the tax based on expected use of vouchers this cycle.\n* The tax money is used to fund the \"vouchers\" and to pay for the elections themselves.   \n* There's a major problem with poorly integrated and underfunded elections, and this would provide a fairly consistent funding source for a department dedicated to running fair, clean, and efficient elections, without lines, without spoiled ballots, with a commitment to fraud detection but ALSO a commitment to giving ANYONE who can legally vote, the ability to vote, without any significant additional burden on them beyond showing up long enough to vote without having to wait in all but the most extreme of circumstances.    \n* It seems more in line with the first amendment, saying that you are absolutely allowed to broadcast your political opinions using your money, but the more that broadcast becomes a major personal imposition on society at large, the more you have to pay back into the society.   \n* It seems fair, since [most people](http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2015/06/02/us/politics/money-in-politics-poll.html?_r=0) clearly feel that large dollar donations are distorting the political landscape in a negative fashion, and taxing social ills is pretty popular even amongst moderate Libertarians and Republicans, who generally can't see a tax without immediately figuring out how to cut or eliminate it. Even Gary Johnson has endorsed a Carbon Tax.   \n\nI think this is a really solid idea, and I also think it's unlikely to happen any time soon, same as I feel about [Range Voting](https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/4yf30w/cmvinstant_runoff_voting_is_only_slightly_better/) .  \nIn both cases, I think we'll see SOME sort of reform in the next decade or so, I just doubt it will be this one. Because no one's talking about either. So.... let's talk about that.\nSo have at it, try to refute it, refine it, or revise it. I'll be handing out delta's for \n\n1-Admittedly, Gary Johnson, (soft?)Libertarian that he is has endorse removing all caps on donations, but requiring they go direct to the candidate, and that it be public, interestingly Stein has essentially endorsed the opposite, requiring all donations be anonymous, and I think small, but certainly no corporations. \n\n_____\n\n> *Hello, users of CMV!

            "selftext": "This is not a typical claim that solely because Hillary Clinton is a woman, all women should vote for her. This is also not a claim trying to bash Donald Trump in all possible ways. However, this is a belief I hold, as a woman, looking to be treated as a human. While in Beijing, on September 5, 1995, First Lady Hillary Clinton, stated \u201cHuman rights are women\u2019s rights, and women\u2019s rights are human rights.\u201d Since then, Hillary Clinton has been fighting to make the lives of women and men equal. Aside from women\u2019s rights she has helped attain healthcare for millions of children, continues to stand up for LGBT rights around the world, and previously ensured 911 victims and response members that they would receive the healthcare and resources they needed to recover. These are few among many of the accomplishments Hillary Clinton has to her name. Her website, HillaryforAmerica lists more and her goals and concrete plans for the future. \n\nDue to her experience and evidence of work completed in the political realm, there is no doubt in my mind that Hillary is the most qualified candidate for the presidency of the United States. However, men and women, as with all candidates, continue to deny the truths about the good she has done and disqualify her due to her personal life and \u201cBenghazi background.\u201d Does it matter for our future if Hillary Clinton really has a bout of pneumonia right now? Does it matter for our future if her husband had a previous affair? The truth is, what matters is often what is ignored. Hillary is ready for stand up for the middle class, she is ready to reform healthcare, she is ready to demand paid maternity leave, she is ready to raise the minimum wage, and she is ready to make college affordable. She is determined to let go of the past and focus on the future; she is not afraid to make the largest investments needed for America. \n\nIt is also my belief that children need to be raised in a world that does not allow only men to set demands with a demeanor that women simply do not have. They need to be raised in a world where sexual and racial inequality does not exist, where all human beings are treated with respect, and a country that continues to be strengthened by the bonds of all ethnicities and cultures. I believe seeing a woman in office will help the youth understand that no dream is too far out of sight. Hillary Clinton previously held the title of Secretary of State, Senator, and First Lady, and has been an advocate for women's rights for many years. This is why I believe she is a qualified woman running for the office of presidency and why I believe that other women should vote for her. I believe she will be able to eliminate the inequalities and double-standards surrounding women because of her experience. However, candidates sometimes do not do what they promise and this is why I am open to learning about why you may believe that she is not that best choice.  \n\n> *Hello, users of CMV!

            "selftext": "For the past 8 elections I have seen that in many ways the candidates from each party have both been in my opinion bad candidates. Each time I felt that if I were voting I would be picking between the lesser of two evils. I voted for the first time in a presidential election in 2012, and I voted for Romney who I saw as the lesser of two evils. Since then I have come to put a lot more weight on how I vote. I now see my vote as putting my name behind that person. Therefor I want to vote for someone who I not only agree with, but that I believe will stick to what their saying on the campaign trail after they have been elected. This brings me to why I can\u2019t vote for Trump. My reasons are:\n\n* He has flip flopped on multiple stances some that I agree with others that I do not (http://www.nbcnews.com/politics/2016-election/full-list-donald-trump-s-rapidly-changing-policy-positions-n547801). Because of that flip flopping I have no idea where he stands for sure on each issue. If he even does have a strong stance on many of the issues, which he very well may not. He seems to pick which ever position will get him the most approval with the audience he is speaking to.\n\n* He believes in multiple traditionally Democratic stances. He supports tariffs instead of free trade. (http://www.latimes.com/opinion/op-ed/la-oe-navarro-trump-trade-china-tariffs-20160721-snap-story.html)\n He supports government paid maternity leave for women. (http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/donald-trump-maternity-leave_us_57d7fe3fe4b0fbd4b7bb5f27)     \n\n* I have no Idea what he\u2019s actually going to do in office. His son has already told the media that Pence would be the one in charge of foreign and domestic policy (http://www.nytimes.com/2016/07/20/magazine/how-donald-trump-picked-his-running-mate.html?_r=0) . So what exactly is Trump going to be doing in office?\n\n* There is a good chance that the Republicans could control congress after this election. If Trump is elected and congress is controlled by Republicans there won\u2019t be anything stopping him from pushing through his policies.\n\nWhile I greatly dislike Trump, I dislike Hillary Clinton even more. I know that she would do very little that lines up with my views. The one upside that I see to a Clinton Presidency is, if the Republicans do control congress, they will vehemently oppose everything she will try to do. This means that most of her policies will be stopped in congress.\n\nAt the moment I see the Libertarian Party candidate, Gary Johnson, as my favorite. The basis of the Libertarian party is people should have the freedom to do whatever they want as long as they are not infringing on other people\u2019s rights. I tend to agree with this view. If I\u2019m not doing something that infringes on someone else\u2019s rights there shouldn\u2019t be an issue with what I\u2019m doing. The biggest issue I see with voting third party is that they have no chance of winning. It\u2019s almost as if I\u2019m \u201cThrowing my vote away.\u201d Many will argue that not voting for Trump is a vote for Hillary or vice versa.\n\nOn top of all this I live in Pennsylvania, which will be a key swing state in the election. This means that my vote could have a more significant impact then if I lived in a state that will definitely go Republican or Democrat.\n\nI have been thinking about all of this for the last four months, since Trump became the Republican nominee. Do I vote for someone I agree with on most topics. Or do I vote for someone I disagree with on most topics but maybe the lesser of two evils. At the moment I\u2019m leaning toward voting for Johnson, but I still have many doubts. I would like to be presented with enough good arguments, facts, and stats to help move me towards voting for Trump.\n\n_____\n\n> *Hello, users of CMV! This is a footnote from your moderators.

            "selftext": "While Donald Trump has many policies I disagree with, I do not think he\u2019d be able to implement many of them due to lack of support in Congress. The main area the president has acting power, however, is foreign relations and his role as commander in cheif. I am basing my opinion on Donald\u2019s recent Commander in Chief forum as well as other comments he has made over the last several months. \n\nFirst let's talk about our allies. Trump has said that he won\u2019t come to the aid of countries who don\u2019t \u2018pay their bills.\u2019 While talks with NATO countries about treaty obligations for military spending is a legitimate topic, implying that we would not come to the aid of our allies undermines the entire premise of the treaty. NATO only works if an impending power would fear immediate action from all signatories no matter what. Trump\u2019s remarks completely undermine this treaty which has been the cornerstone of US foreign policy since WWII. He was specifically asked about Baltic States, who did not hesitate to answer the NATO call when the US invaded it for Afghanistan. Implying the Baltic States have not supported NATO is ignorant and isolates our allies in Eastern Europe. \n\nThe next area that concerns me is Eastern Asia and China. It is no secret that [Trump is against free trade and has suggested tariffs on goods from countries like China](http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/article/2016/jun/21/donald-trump-has-floated-big-tariffs-what-could-im/).The idea that these tariffs would completely save US industry is also pretty off base. [We tried this strategy](https://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/CHRG-107hhrg81372/html/CHRG-107hhrg81372.htm) to protect the steel industry in the early 2000s and the economic impact was overwhelmingly negative. Obviously the topic of complicated trade agreements is an area of debate, but I think that the major problem with tariffs on China means the US will open itself to retaliatory tariffs from our largest trading partner. Not only will this degrade our precarious relationship with China, but domestically the US will see an increase in the price of most goods.\n\nI think Trump would further destabilize South Eastern Asia due to his isolationist rhetoric. If NATO is up for debate under Trump, key allies like South Korea or Japan will be rightfully worry they do not have unwavering US support in the face of an expanding China. Without the US to counterbalance China\u2019s influence in the South China Sea and the always aggressive DPRK, our allies may have to explore other options. \n\nFInally, let's look towards his general demeanor. The main Trump comment I have an issue with is when he called on Russia to \u201cfind\u201d the rest of Hillary\u2019s emails. Regardless of the validity of Hillary\u2019s email scandal, calling for an outside power to interfere in a US election should be a disqualifying statement as its blatantly illegal. I would say this statement, along with many others, is fundamentally unpresidential. I know many people like his \u2018tell it how it is\u2019 persona, but his temperament isn\u2019t something that will help foreign relations. I believe having a president who is calm, composed, and wants to know all of the facts before acting is invaluable when in command of the world\u2019s most powerful military. [The remarks he has already made have given foreign leaders concern](http://www.latimes.com/world/europe/la-fg-hollande-trump-analysis-20160803-snap-story.html) and if he continues with this trend relations will most likely continue to worsen.. Overall, simply being Donald Trump has made foreign leaders less likely to want to work with him. \n\nWhile I\u2019m not claiming the US has had a perfect foreign policy track record, I think it is undeniable that our actions have all been based (rightly or wrongly) on the idea that it will perpetuate the United States\u2019 global dominance. I think a Donald Trump presidency will isolate our allies and empower our rivals. He has no experience and his brash personality will prove detrimental to foreign relations and prove he is not capable of acting as commander in chief. However because it is a possibility he may actually be running our country in a few months, I\u2019d love it if someone can put my mind at ease. Please CMV\n_____\n\n> *Hello, users of CMV!

            "selftext": "To begin with, I am not saying that I support Trump 100% or even agree with many of his social views. However, I do believe that if we (United States citizens) want not only an improved economy, but an economy that is going to be more stable then I believe we should elect Trump to be our next President. In the end, most elections usually come back to the economy\u2014to jobs, wages, taxes, imports and exports, the price of goods and the cost of an education. If this holds true, then I believe we should elect Mr. Trump, and here\u2019s why. \n\nTo begin with, Trump\u2019s tax plan is the root of everything he wants to do economically. In case some of you don\u2019t know, Mr. Trump\u2019s plan is that individual income tax brackets would be reduced to three: 12 percent, 25 percent, and 33 percent. Furthermore, Trump also proposed a lowered top corporate tax rate of 15 percent, down from the current 35 percent rate. Additionally, to keep companies in the U.S., Trump also included a 10 percent tax on repatriation, and outlined an incentivizing proposal to allow U.S.-based manufacturer to fully expense the cost of their plants and equipment. (Electing to do this, under the Trump plan, would mean companies would give up the ability to deduct interest expense). Overall, Trump\u2019s team proposed a $4.4 trillion tax cut (scored as $2.6 trillion under a dynamic growth model). \n\nBecause of the tax cuts that will happen under Trump, the amount of money being spent by consumers is going to increase drastically under Trump. Anyone who knows economics will know that this is a formula for economic growth. People who want to consume more can use their tax cut for that purpose; people who want to save more can use theirs to buy up the new government bonds (the government will sell more bonds to make up the budget shortfall created by the tax cuts). This is the perfect scenario during a recession, or when the economy is not where it\u2019s supposed to be, to be considered sufficient and stable (which many would say is the case right now).\n\nFurthermore, Trump said his economic plan rejects the cynicism that our labor force will keep declining, that our jobs will keep leaving and that our economy will never grow as it did before. His campaign claims that his plan would increase GDP growth to 3.5 percent. Trump suggests that 4 percent growth is possible. Trump says that under his plan, he will create twenty-five million jobs. Although I am not positive that Trump will hit his benchmark of 25 million jobs, I do believe that Trump will create millions of jobs. To begin with, Trump has been extremely vocal by slamming the outsourcing of auto manufacturers. Furthermore, as stated earlier, Trump\u2019s tax plan included a 10 percent tax on repatriation, and outlined an incentivizing proposal to allow U.S.-based manufacturer to fully expense the cost of their plants and equipment. (Electing to do this, under the Trump plan, would mean companies would give up the ability to deduct interest expense).  What Trump is basically going to do is cut the outsourcing of manufacturers, which in theory will create jobs in America. \n\nWith more people working and consumers spending more money, this will ultimately lead to making the middle class stronger and more stable. This has been a major problem in the United States in the past, and a major debate point amongst politicians. So, if we want a more stable and improved economy, we should Elect Trump to office. \n\n_____\n\n> *Hello, users of CMV! This is a footnote from your moderators.

            "selftext": "Look at me, flipping the dichotomy.\n\nI think that if you live in a \u201csafe-state,\u201d such as California/New York and Alabama/Oklahoma, you should be voting third-party (assuming you are not satisfied with Trump or Clinton, which is the majority of people). By all means, if you have no inhibitions voting for Clinton or Trump, do it \u2013 this argument probably isn\u2019t for you. My logic stems from the nature of the electoral college. Whether a candidate wins by 30% or 0.5%, they still win all of that state\u2019s votes in the college. So, if you live in New York, where there is not the slightest doubt that Hillary Clinton will win, then if you vote for Clinton your vote is wasted since that vote has an incredibly small chance of effecting the end result. This also applies if you are voting for Trump in New York, Trump in Alabama or Clinton in Alabama \u2013 your vote will almost certainly not effect that state\u2019s results. This is why I see votes for major candidates as \u201cwasted,\u201d especially in the light of my next point.\n\nWhen you vote for a candidate, you are not just voting for them to become president \u2013 there are many other aspects to that vote. There is the abstract power of that vote, such as how that vote makes the candidate \u2013 and their respective party \u2013 more influential/legitimate/known/etc. There is also the more material power of that vote. When a candidate receives over 5% of the vote in the general election, which Gary Johnson will likely reach if current trends hold and Jill Stein might reach, they receive federal funding for the next presidential election. Now, the power of that vote is \u2013 again \u2013 wasted on either Donald Trump or Hillary Clinton. They and their parties are already influential, legitimate and known by all Americans (while also being universally disliked). The Democratic and Republican parties also have no problem receiving federal and private funding. Therefore, the power of your vote \u2013 in this sense \u2013 is completely lost when you vote for either of these major candidates.\n\nI live in Connecticut. Here, Clinton has about a 10-point lead over Trump as of my time writing this \u2013 and this has held steady for most of the election and shows no sign of changing. I\u2019ve thought to myself whether my position would change if the race tightened in my own state. After some thinking, I decide it probably wouldn\u2019t. Right now, as I previously explained, voting for Clinton or Trump in Connecticut would be pointless. Surely it wouldn\u2019t still be worthless if the race was statistically tied \u2013 right? Unless the race tightened because of something related directly to Connecticut, most likely Trump would have gained in every other state as well. This would mean the swing states would be painted red and Trump would have the election in the bag, making my vote basically worthless in a whole new way thanks to the electoral college.\n\nI don\u2019t think anybody who is voting third party this November actually thinks their candidate would become president. I would probably join in with you in laughing at them for thinking something so absurd is possible. I\u2019m looking beyond this election, as there is clearly no hope in this one. I have heard many friends of mine say, \u201cYou can\u2019t vote third-party. You have to work in the system we have now.\u201d Well, that\u2019s exactly what I plan to do, I\u2019m using the system I\u2019m given to the best of my ability. My vote is something that cannot be denied by those already in power. The \u201ccorrect\u201d avenues to change that I\u2019m told of almost always involve relying on those in charge to listen and make change for me. This is the one true power that I have, and I want to use it to its greatest potency.\n\nI have never heard of anyone else hold this position before (with these reasons). I\u2019m sure I\u2019m not the first to think of this, but I\u2019m interested in hearing your thoughts. Also, this is my first post on Reddit if that interests you.\n\n_____\n\n> *Hello, users of CMV! This is a footnote from your moderators. We'd just like to remind you of a couple of things.

For the past few decades, we\u2019ve been working to create equality between men and women, but even after so many years, men still have an easier time when running for a government position than women do. This is because women receive a higher degree of scrutiny that is typically related to appearance. We are constantly putting more pressures on the females in politics by creating double standards, which makes it harder for women to rise in the political world.\n\nFor example, women are frequently judged based on how they sound which makes it more difficult for them to be viewed in a positive manner. This is very evident in the current U.S. presidential election there are numerous areas where the criticism of Hillary Clinton has been more harsh or shallow, that is to say more related to her appearance or demeanor, than the criticism towards Donald Trump. People get hung up on how \u201cshrill\u201d Hillary Clinton sounds. This causes snap judgments and immediate negativity towards her due to how she sounds, but not because of what she says. For instance, in an article from Time giving advice to both Trump and Clinton for the upcoming debates [x](http://time.com/4471573/debate-advice-for-donald-trump-and-hillary-clinton/), one of the listed suggestions for Clinton is to use a moderate vocal tone. The reasoning given is that voters have never seen or heard a woman\u2019s voice at this level of the campaign and being labeled as shrill will hurt her chances. This is the only piece of advice in the article that deals with how the voters will perceive a candidate and it is not a coincidence that it is given to the female candidate.\n\nIn addition, we place merit on how emotional politicians appear, but the way we view emotion differs when comparing men and women. This is illustrated clearly in a clip from The Daily Show with Jon Stewart [x](http://www.cc.com/video-clips/09yfp5/the-daily-show-with-jon-stewart-the-broads-must-be-crazy---belittled-women). Stewart pinpoints how the media portrays men and women differently, even if they are presenting the same emotion. For instance, when men cry it is viewed as sincere and brave, but when women cry it is seen as a breakdown and a weakness. Viewing women in this light makes it much more difficult for them to get support from the public. In addition, knowing their emotions will most likely be viewed negatively, women in politics have become inclined to show less emotion. Hillary Clinton has mentioned that even though it has been effective for male politicians in the past, she has become skeptical of an emotional appeal because she would be attacked with great fervor[x](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/is-she-likable-enough/2016/09/23/5c8fd252-80e0-11e6-a52d-9a865a0ed0d4_story.html). To put it another way, Clinton is trying to avoid using a political strategy that has worked in the past because she is a woman and knows that means it could backfire.\n\nUsing yet another recent example, Clinton was criticized by the RNC Chair for not smiling at a national security forum [x](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/is-she-likable-enough/2016/09/23/5c8fd252-80e0-11e6-a52d-9a865a0ed0d4_story.html). Clinton responded by reminding us that she was speaking about a serious matter making her lack of pleasure justifiable. The fact that it was even necessary for her to justify her appearance shows just how much women are scrutinized especially in political settings. It makes women appear less qualified to the voters because of the mindset we hold onto which makes us believe men are more suited for powerful jobs.\n\n\n_____\n\n> *Hello, users of CMV!

I'm also Asian, and not an American. But all of those are not the point, here.\n\nBlack Lives Matter is a disgusting hate group which calls for the death of cops, blocks roads, protests violently, all while hiding behind the innocent guise of 'race equality'.\n\n'All Lives Matter' to them is apparently also disrespectful and racist. How can the fact that all human life is sacred be racist? They race-bait, riot, and damage community property, too. \n\nMost of these people aren't victims, either. They're just rebels, under the exhilaration of feeling that they're rebelling against the corrupt government, when they don't even realize that the cops are the ones risking their lives daily to protect America, while they're the ones inconveniencing the public, robbing stores, and inciting violence against the police.\n\nThey defend criminals just because the criminals are black, too. Is there not something inherently wrong with that?\n\nSo guys, CMV please. I cannot see the appeal in supporting a group that claims 'All Lives Matter' is racist.\n\n**EDIT: For clarification, I do not hate black people. I do not hate any race. We are all humans.**\n\n_____\n\n> *Hello, users of CMV! This is a footnote from your moderators. We'd just like to remind you of a couple of things.

            "selftext": "Let me just say now that this is not a thread to discuss whether or Donald Trump ought to be president; my view is that he's a national embarrassment, the worst mainstream presidential candidate in US history, and utterly unqualified to hold any public office, and I'm not likely to change that view any time soon. What I want to discuss is the extremely unusual and alarming nature of this election cycle, and what it means for the future of America and the world.\n\nThe tl;dr is this: **Donald Trump has essentially changed the rules of American political culture in such a way that he's completely erased any standards of decency, honesty or credibility from the electoral process.** Things that would have ended political careers before this election cycle have now become so normal with Trump that no one even cares. And that bodes very, very poorly for the future.\n\nWhile [this](https://www.hillaryclinton.com/feed/things-donald-trump-has-said-and-done-that-in-a-normal-election-would-disqualify-a-nominee/) source is obviously biased, it aggregates, using external sources, the evidence for the point I'm making, and which we all understand already: Donald Trump has said and done a lot of insane, deplorable shit and somehow still has a very real shot at becoming president. What the hell is going on here? Remember just four years ago, when Mitt Romney's \"takers\" blunder nearly sank his campaign, and almost certainly contributed to his defeat at the polls? Remember when a single gaffe like that was nearly fatal to a presidential candidate? What the fuck has happened over the past four years? And what's going to happen in the future? As we near the debates, which are all but guaranteed to be a shitshow unlike anything we've seen before, I can't help but wonder.\n\nEven if Trump loses, I worry about the next lunatic, and the next one. Trump has paved the way for more candidates as bad or worse than him, and if he can come this close to winning now, it seems to me like it's only a matter of time before someone of his ilk gets elected. Thanks to Trump, and his supporters, we've entered a bizarre alternate dimension where candidates can lie about basically anything, and no matter how fucking crazy or bigoted they get, it means nothing at all to their supporters. Feelings have completely \"trumped\" facts and logic for a huge portion of the voting demographic. This anti-intellectual undercurrent has been strong in American politics since forever, but I never thought it could get this bad. Nor did many others. We were wrong. And now I'm legitimately worried about the future.\n\n**EDIT: This is not a thread about Hillary Clinton either; she is dishonest but in no way remarkable in that regard. She's far more qualified, and certainly doesn't lie as shamelessly as Trump, or pander to xenophobia nearly as much. This is part of my view that you're not going to change. So if you're going to try to derail the thread, kindly move along.**\n\n**EDIT EDIT: For those disappointed that I awarded a delta, the rules say to award one if someone changes your view \"in some way.\" The poster in question did convince me that I may be overstating the problem, and that the future may not be as dim as I made it out to be. But I nevertheless still hold the concerns outlined in the OP.**",

I think both candidates are great in their own ways - both are talented, (in different ways) both are intelligent (on different levels) and clearly the whole community - the US and the world too - needs both viewpoints. \n(Naturally both have a shadow side and it is okay to criticize each other - but in a respectful civilized way.) I can accept that the no-barrier BS is a much needed stylistic specialty of trumpists. They have no real knowledge about most things or events in the world. So they feel bad and must discharge their stresses. \nIt reinforces  a general sinking of communication level and raising of temperament: a worldwide culture of resentment and aggression. But maybe the sincerity and straithforwardness in it makes it worth - as a learning process it can be useful. Nothing can be done to change that   - so most people are ready to accept it as a given. \nI would like to argue that the lies about the other side ( like the clich\u00e9 that \"Clinton is crooked\" because she used - like all Senators  on weekend - her home server that did not cause any problem as she was cautious enough or the projection that voicing concerns about possible aggression from minorities or out-groups means Trump is \"racist\".) I simply cannot understand how it came about that hundred millions of people are unable to appreciate the huge work a candidate must do to be able to carry the message of half of the population - while clearly we must hear both sides' main arguments. \nAnd how can they speak in a humiliating tone about two worthy and likeable people.\n\n_____\n\n> *Hello, users of CMV!

But this isn't a typical election year. Trump doesn't seem bound by the rules of normal candidates; many things that would have sunk a traditional candidate have actually helped him (like the attack on Megyn Kelly, which was one of the most memorable moments of the primary debates). He went from being a long shot joke candidate to the party nominee by dominating media coverage through his outrageous remarks. Every time we heard that something could be the end of Trump, his poll numbers improved.\n\nIt will be the same with this debate. The winner of this debate will not be the candidate who makes the best case for their presidency, but rather the candidate who gains the most attention out of the debate. It won't matter who makes better arguments or who is more factually accurate. All that matters is who's in the news more. And that candidate, regardless of what happens, is bound to be Trump. Consider a few possible scenarios:\n\n1) Trump says something that causes outrage.\n\n2) Trump has a major gaffe\n\n3) Trump is rude to Clinton, by insulting or interrupting her.\n\n4) Trump outperforms expectations and does his best to be civil and look presidential.\n\nIn all 4, Trump wins. In 1) or 2), the clip of what Trump says will be the most played moment of the debate. What Clinton says becomes effectively irrelevant to the post-debate conversation. It's basically the same with 3). The story would be how Trump hasn't changed for this debate. In the case of 4), even if Trump severely underperforms compared to Clinton, the story will be how he's changed his tone and looks more presidential. Even if Clinton performs considerably better, it won't be the main story.\n\nSo, regardless of what happens tonight, Trump, and not Clinton, will be the main story on the news tomorrow, and because of that, he's already won the debate.",

            "selftext": "Donald Trump is a controversial fellow. Everyone can see that. He has a lot of strong ideas on delicate subjects, and isn't shy to let everyone know his opinions. He is a legitimate representative of the capitalist, right-wing politician, being a business owner and a (former) television show host. \n\nI propose the following: on today's modern Western society, having an opinion has become a crime. It either is a left-guided opinion, and therefore a crime for the right, or it is a right-guided opinion, and therefore a crime for the left. Only the left seems to have tightened its grip on Western society over the last few years, going so far as to institute \"safe spaces\" on colleges for people that feel offended at things other people say, and taking advice from anyone, simply because that person can string together a sentence from a bunch of words.\n\nAnd then comes Donald Trump. A man who isn't shy to say that Muslims are a threat, and that Islam isn't a religion of peace. A man who isn't afraid to say that illegal immigrants are a problem that needs to be addressed. A man who isn't afraid to say a woman needs to work for equal pay, just like everyone else. And he gets labeled a \"fascist\", \"sexist\", \"racist\", \"bigot\", and, most infuriating of all, \"**literally** Hitler\". \n\nIn my personal view, Donald Trump is a necessary man. He is showing the West that words aren't made out of lead and shot from our mouths at sound-barrier-breaking speeds, so they can't be treated like weapons. He is showing us that the opinions the media tells you are \"common\" might not be so \"common\" after all. He is showing us that, by going at those you believe are wrong, and holding your ground, you will find supporters. He is showing us that there is no endemic hatred against any race by being supported by all of them (I don't mean all individuals of every race, I mean representatives, at least some, of every race). \n\nBy challenging the *status quo* of political correctness, Trump shows us the real problems we are facing once the \"safe space, whateverphobia\" bullshit is lifted from our eyes. And that's worth something.\n\nNow, I know a lot of people disagree with what he says, and that's normal, that's politics. I'm not here to defend whatever he says (even though I realize I presented his speech in a very preachy manner). I'm here to defend, as Voltaire said, his right to say whatever he wants to. \n\nPlease don't argue his statements on the comments. They aren't the main focus here. The focus is, he is making statements that challenge the norm of today. And I think that is a good thing. Change my view, Reddit! :D\n\n**TL;DR: Donald Trump is, by challenging political correctness, changing the landscape of Western politics for the best.**\n\n_____\n\n> *Hello, users of CMV!

            "selftext": "This is not a call-to-action to go vote Clinton.  If you always disagreed with her policies, then keep doing so.  \n\nBut I think the liberals who say \"anyone but Clinton\" aren't being honest with themselves for the real reasons.  I have been one of them.  \n\n**She's Not Progressive Enough**\n\nShe supported universal health care since the 90's and her CHIP program is covering millions of millennials.  Do you think she would've compromised on conservative policies if she had her way?\n\nA lot of it is idealism.  It's painful for progressives to accept that they need to wait on line.  Being the perfect progressive is more wishful.\n\n**Wall Street**\n\nObama had twice the money from Wall Street she got and she's well-liked.  Plenty of Democrats with lower disapproval ratings get big money.\n\n**The Clintons Are Corrupt**\n\nWhich Clintons?  Chelsea?  No, she's well liked and isn't a political figure.  Bill?  He's had high approval ratings and has a higher approval amongst people of all sides of the spectrum than most politicians.  Okay, so it's just Hillary really.  They're not a super-powerful family with generations of wealth.  Bill and Hillary became lawyers and they had 1 child.\n\n**I Don't Want a Dynastic Presidency**\n\nIt really seems like the gambler's luck fallacy, as to where either Clinton would've been non-aristocratic in either scenario.  Is this really relevant in terms of what the policies and results would look like? \n\n**Trade**\n\nBut why is this a recent issue?  Where was the anti-globalist movement before Trump?  Not very far along.  It seems like protectionism is the new trend and free trade is painted as just another way of the old guard trying to keep people down.\n\nTPP was crafted in 2013.   Aversion of it were rare.\n\n**Anti-War**\n\nIf you're genuinely anti-war, that's fine, but I largely think this is used as a defense purely because it's unassailable.  If someone says \"I won't vote Clinton because I can't deal with the bombings of innocent people\", it's untenable to argue against it and therefore the perfect front to cover up an inherent bias.\n\nDo the wars in the middle-east really bother you on a deep level?  Are you politically active against them?  It really just seems like something that's brought up just because it's tough to justify military policy in a few sentences. \n\n**I Hate Politics**\n\nIf Kasich were the nominee, there wouldn't be nearly as much confusion or hatred.  Kasich and Clinton would debate the policies, and yes, fans of each would still be really passionate and forceful, but the two would be able to have a civil conversation without name-calling.\n\nIt would be a straight election.  It would be two establishment politicians and people would pick their side.  Trump presents a crisis in which there is a choice of no prior precedent and it has resulted in a dillemma.\n\n**I Want to Vote Third Party or not vote**\n\nIf you truly feel that way, fine.  But if your stance is \"I want Clinton to win but I won't pull the trigger\", it's a dishonest position (like staying in a dead marriage because of sanctity) You're okay with the decision so long as you don't bear the title.  With voting third party, there's a sense of pride as in \"Hey, I opposed Trump without having to sell my soul\".\n\n**Coolness**\n\nIf you are a millennial, and you support Clinton, people would frown on you for promoting a government they view as oppressive.\n_____\n\n> *Hello, users of CMV!

This is in contrast to common (and I believe justified to an extent) criticism of Obama, who made a lot of promises to close Guantanamo but in the end wasn't capable of it, and also got cock-blocked by congress at every turn.\n\nThe flipside is, if he isn't capable of those things, then a good portion of this doomsday talk about the election is really overblown, and it doesn't really matter that much in the end who gets elected.",

However, that is not what this post is about.\nThroughout this election cycle, I have heard many criticisms of Donald Trump some of which I believe to be valid and others that I do not.  One criticism I have never bought into however is that Trump is a racist.  \nTo begin with, for the purposes of validating my claim the definition of racism is just the standard Webster definition given here:\n>Racism- prejudice, discrimination, or antagonism directed against someone of a different race based on the belief that one's own race is superior.\n\nIf you want to debate this definition, feel free to, but I believe it to be a fair and comprehensive definition and this is a viewpoint that I'm unlikely to change anytime soon.\nTo the main point however, I think it's fair to say that Trump has said many controversial things this election.  However, to my knowledge none of these claims can be labeled \"racist\" by the above definition, let alone does a single isolated racist statement qualify for labeling a person racist in my opinion.  As a point of clarification, I agree with the fact that many of the aforementioned controversial statements are by nature bigoted and generalize a group of people, but almost all of these address either people who either come from a certain country, adhere to some ideology, or have performed a certain action.  So while he may be deemed bigoted as a result of these statements, I can't justify calling him a racist.  Therefore, to me claims of Trump's alleged racism have had little impact on my feelings toward him as a candidate.  CMV",

However, if a Republican votes third-party instead of voting Trump, I don't see how this can be construed to do anything other than damage Trump's chances. In fact, for someone who is typically a Republican, I think it would be more valid to consider their third-party vote to be a vote for Hillary than a vote for Trump.\n\nI'm particularly looking for the two following opinions to be changed (Deltas for changing either one, but I'd really appreciate seeing reasoning for both, since a successful argument against 2 will effectively invalidate 1 as well):\n\n1) Without prior knowledge of their political leanings, an arbitrary person's third-party vote cannot be considered to be helping one candidate more than the other.\n\n2) Particularly in the case of self-professed Republican voters, who would typically vote Republican in an election, their third-party votes are most rightly considered to be helping Hillary.\n_____\n\n> *Hello, users of CMV!

            "selftext": "The jobs will never come back. Today, robots are as capable as humans. For now, they cost a little bit more.\nThe best medical doctor in the world is software. (see: Watson) Driving is a very complex task with many emergent variables, but the systems are almost ready to take over the roads. The engineers working on that will move onto new and better challenges soon.\n\n\u00a0\n\nAnesthesiologists and pharmacists lobbied congress to protect their jobs in the 90s, because they realized they were already obsolete. Next is surgeons.\n\nNAFTA really was the worst thing to ever happen to the American blue collar worker. We once had an economy that could support itself, but there is no rewinding the tape. Food goods are kept artificially cheap, our government pays $6,000 per household in food subsidies to keep meat and milk on America's tables.\n\n\u00a0\n\nThe economic \"recovery\" since 1998 is largely minimum wage positions. Median wage has fallen $2000.\n\nI have never had a job I personally couldn't design a robot to do, and I am not the cleverest of gents. Soon, management positions will become software and our workforce won't have anything left to aspire to. Soon, schools may become software on tablets. Soon robot police will arrive and be celebrated as the solution to discrimination. Soon high school diplomas will be obsolete.\n\n\u00a0\n\nWe are staring into the maw of automation and it is set to swallow us up, unless we stand together as a single human unit. We cannot afford to be blinded by bigotry. We cannot let politics divide us or believe we can find a savior.\n\nThere are no superheros. Jesus will not come down and make things right with his wizardly ways. New pope is awesome though, I love that dude.\n\n \u00a0\n\nI always hear \"A new industry will appear.\" and they would be right except that there is no wealth in the American populace to support an emergent industry. No new good will meaningfully employ us all. Robots are as skilled as the average human. All \"pick it up put it down\" tasks can be automated. Loading machines, delivering packages, mail, food prep. What do we do when half of everyone is obsolete?\n\n\u00a0\n\nDo we wait until they are starving and find a reactionary solution?\n\n\u00a0\n\nTechnology was the answer, once. If we could all create, buy, and sell digital artworks. Trade software between each other, create physical art and unique fixtures and fittings. Unfortunately our populace is hypnotized by long hours and by falling wages into buying only the cheapest from a big box. There are a few bastions of hope like Etsy and Ebay, but it is difficult to produce high quality goods, and most people are only skilled at following instructions.\n\n\u00a0\n\nMy father worked for $12 an hour roofing in the 80s. Today that's over $30 an hour today. We have been squeezed slowly, until today, the dreams of our youth must either be \"go to college and take on a chain of debt\" or work 50 hours a week and still struggle to house and clothe your growing family. No-one has the time or resources to experiment.  The next new dream is constantly forgotten by the man already struggling.\n\n\u00a0\n\nNo individuals can afford to bring a new tech to market without being captured by the big players, even with huge grassroots support. (see: Oculus Rift)\n\n\u00a0\n\nWealth stratification is worse than before the great depression. We are on the precipice of a bubble collapse. The bubble of nonviolent of poverty. Black lives matter is the face screaming into the tempest. If we squeeze them any harder, its going to get ugly. I don't want to live in a war zone, and I don't want to watch them all get rounded up into concentration camps either. The only reason they haven't lashed out is their oppressor has no singe face.\n\n\u00a0\n\nIf we can't all embrace the socialist inside and effectively harness the engines of wealth existent in this country today, we will all die in poverty and war. If we can't find a way to let every human participate in capitalism, we will find a dystopian police state is unavoidable.\n\n\u00a0\n\nEdward Snowden exposed systems and software that are the gestapo's wet dreams. If things don't make an about face, we will see brutality unmatched since 50 years ago. They are all set up to stomp us all if we get unruly, and they have the tools to do it quietly, despite technology and the internet.\n\n\u00a0\n\nWhat does it mean when large players (see: pharmaceutical companies) begin to pump and dump the economy for short term profits, risking regulation or lawsuit. Are they so confident they are untouchable, or do they see disaster coming and want to get theirs?\n\n\u00a0\n\nBernie Sanders gave me hope, took away my fantasies of walking into traffic. Hillary Clinton stomped on my hope.  She will not effect the change Sanders promised. She will put up a tax here or there, and maybe even reduce college costs, but it will not ease the burden on us all.  She will not take on insurance companies, she will not fix the biggest problems, just patch the easy ones. \n\nShe will not ask the people to come out to support her against congress, while Bernie stated a willingness to call us to the streets, he told us that he would need our help to create a rising tide to lift all boats.\n\nHillary needs only our votes. (see: Debbie Wasserman Schultz) She will pay lip service to any cause to get them, while rewarding her cronies.\n\nTrump will outrage the world, but not enough to collapse it on us. \n\n\u00a0\n\nI badly need a solution other than, \"Hope things turn around.\" I am dying over here. I need to see a world that will not be constantly falling deeper in despair. \n\n\nedit: 2008->1998, removed made up percentage in favor of ambiguity",

            "selftext": "Recently, there has been some debate about what role the moderators should take in a presidential debate. Some argue that the moderator should be more avidly fact-checking the debates, while others argue that such a proposition would be overrun with bias.\n\nHowever, there were a few moments where candidates made statements that are objectively incorrect. It's true, matters of hypothetical policy cannot be objectively measured. However, matters of public record can be. [Here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PlI5l41Hpww) is Donald Trump incorrectly claiming that he has not called global warming a Chinese hoax. [Here's a long list of tweets (plus one video!) where he does](https://np.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/54o7o1/donald_trump_absolutely_did_say_global_warming_is/d83lqqb?context=3) very clearly call global warming a hoax. And for the sake of fairness, Hillary Clinton [absolutely did call the TPP the \"gold standard,\"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q124hZLKpeQ) no \"hope it would be\" anywhere to be found.\n\nMost of these are big talking points, and a candidate has to know that these topics would be brought up. Both Trump saying Clinton called TPP the \"gold standard\" and Clinton saying Trump called global warming a \"Chinese hoax\" are *objectively true statements.* They are on the record. And there needs to be a protocol for that objective evidence to be presented to the public. In both events, the candidate against which the claims were made interrupted with a form of protest. Trump claimed he never said that, while Clinton tried to twist the context into a \"hope it will\" situation, even though that is not how it was delivered. Particularly in a debate like this one, that means no minds will be changed. There is no debate of facts, it's simply he said, she said. Trump supporters will believe Trump is unfairly being attacked, even when it is undeniable fact that he said those things about climate change. Clinton supporters will argue her words were taken out of context, when in-context they don't sound much better. \n\nI don't propose the moderator himself take the role of fact-checker, but both camps should be able to present an indisputable piece of evidence to support them. Instead, they should simply admit or reject evidence presented by the campaigns.\n\nIt's not a perfect solution, and it will change the format of the debates to some extent. However, there are cases where there is objectively correct, and objectively incorrect. Many situations in the debate do not fall into those two categories. However, it's mind-boggling to think that one candidate can say \"I never said that,\" the other can say \"yes you did,\" and the moderator can say \"let's agree to disagree\" and move on to another question. When there is an objective truth, there should be a non-partisan system in place to make it clear to the audience who is in the right, and who is in the wrong.\n_____\n\n> *Hello, users of CMV!

            "selftext": "This is my first CMV, please be kind. This will be a bit unorganized. I'm sorry if this looks like word vomit.\n\nI'm 19 and this will be my first time voting for the next President (obviously), so I'm a bit inexperienced with this whole election thing. I want to think that I can just vote for Trump and it'll be the right thing to do according to my conservative leanings, but to be honest, I find him repulsive. So much so that I'm having doubts that I should vote for him even if he represents my party. Here's some reasons why I feel that way, in no particular order:\n\nI know everybody who runs does their fair share of it, but Trump's campaign seems to rely *too* much on attacking the opposition, worse than anybody I can remember at least in my lifetime. I'm a softie at heart who hates confrontation, so this rubs me the wrong way.\n\nHis proposed ban on Muslims entering the US and \"the Wall\" don't seem like they'll ever get too far. (As a half-Mexican and a person with respect for Muslims, I don't like either idea in the first place.) \n\nOn that note, I don't appreciate some of the things he's said about the country my great grandparents came from. (\"Who's doing the raping?\" etc.)\n\nThere's also some disturbing allegations that he might be creepily interested in his daughter Ivanka, and that alone makes me want to spew. (You can easily Google it if you haven't heard about it) But you don't have to touch on that if you don't want to. I wouldn't blame you, because I think the very thought is just disgusting.\n\nAt the same time, on top of disagreeing with a lot of what she stands for, I feel like I can't trust Hillary Clinton (emails, etc), even though she seems like a nicer person from what I've heard. I really don't want to vote for her either. I understand that voting for a third party candidate is practically useless, too.\n\nIf I vote for Trump and his actions lead to something horrible for the US such as another major war, I'll probably feel guilty for having helped to put him into office. I've also got a lot of years ahead of me so I want to make choices that lead to the best future I can get, of course. \n\nThere's probably not much you can say to convince me that Trump is actually a nice guy; that's not what I came here for anyway. I came here because I need to be reassured that voting for him won't be a mistake.\n\nThis November, I *want* to vote, and vote Republican, but I'm so scared. Please calm my fears if you can.\n_____\n\n> *Hello, users of CMV! This is a footnote from your moderators. We'd just like to remind you of a couple of things.

            "selftext": "Let me start by saying I think we need to elect Hillary Clinton. I am no fan of Clinton but I know her to be the lesser of two inevitable evils. Jill Stein and Gary Johnson are not legitimate options and they present a real spoiler threat to Hillary\u2019s chances. We live under a plurality-rule, first past the post electoral system that invariably marginalizes third parties. I am not a political scientist or a statistician, but I understand Duverger\u2019s Law and the mechanisms of the Electoral College well enough to know we will not see viable third-party presidential candidates unless we fundamentally change how votes are counted. \n\nThat said, I live in Oregon. Oregon has gone blue in every election since Reagan\u2019s victory in 1984. It is an overwhelmingly safe bet that my state\u2019s 7 electoral votes will belong to Hillary Clinton. Oregon is, effectively, sitting this one out, along with 40 other states that have voted for the same party in at least four consecutive presidential elections. My vote will be statistically irrelevant. The only reason to vote at all is to participate on purely ideological grounds. I therefore think the most logical thing to do is to vote third-party to register my discontent. \n\nIf I lived in a swing state, I would find this conclusion wholly untenable. I truly believe we have only two options here and that one option is decidedly less dangerous than the other. That said, I don\u2019t think any critically-minded person can be satisfied with the two major parties\u2019 nominees and that it is up to those of us who live in \u201csafe bet\u201d states to illustrate our displeasure by voting third-party. \n\nMy vote will not change the outcome of the election but it might serve to remind the country that no one is happy with either choice. My role in the election has been reduced to a purely rhetorical exercise, and I believe the best way for me to participate is to cast a \u201cprotest\u201d vote. \n\n\n_____\n\n> *Hello, users of CMV!

            "selftext": "Donald Trump has quite a few problems. He calls Hillary crooked, but he is illegally using his Trump Foundation to enrich himself, he violated the Cuba embargo, possible bribery of an attorney-general (Pam Bondi), he insulted tax payers, he insulted the people that worked for him and subsequently didn\u2019t pay and last but not least his fishy ties with Russia (Manafort, Carter Page). \n\nIf he focusses on Hillary Clinton being crooked, the media will keep go over his business record which is starting to look like a total disaster for a presidential candidate. So it will likely backfire. \n\nIf he focuses on women, he can insult Hillary Clinton for calling out the mistresses of Bill Clinton, feed the conspiracy theorist with possible anti-Clinton allegations and he has the **option to apologize just before the election**. He will be able to **stay in the news** without having to talk about his awful business record and without having to release his tax returns. \n\nIt\u2019s not new that Trump insults women and in the past polls voters didn\u2019t care about it that much. Voters like an anti-establishment candidate and they like alpha males more than they like women. If Donald Trump can stay in the news with something that is not extremely damaging to his campaign (as it is not something new) while jabbing Hillary Clinton with some unproven allegations, he is limiting the damage to his campaign and buying time. The last thing Trump wants is to talk about policies. He is preventing Clinton to talk about policies. \n\nEDIT\nto add a little bit: by staying in the news and insulting women, he is controlling the narrative of the media cycle. The media talks about sex tapes now, instead of policies. That's what Trump wants. \n_____\n\n> *Hello, users of CMV! This is a footnote from your moderators.

            "selftext": "Hating people based on things they can't choose to be and were just born with, such as; race, ethnicity, family, skin color etc. is, as agreed by most, bigotry. No one should do that.\n\nHowever, lately people have been labelling other people who are hating on Muslims or Christians bigoted and racist, even though those are simply religions. They can be changed, and one can simply re-think about their beliefs and constantly change them.\n\nWhy is it okay when people are showing the door to Trump fans, Neo-Nazis, misogynists and other dickheads like that, but why is it not okay when people are hating Muslims? Aren't all of these opinions?\n\nAs far as I'm concerned, no one is really interested in any Trump fans' personality or what they do in their free-time. But why does how \"human\" a Muslim is matter, in a way to \"justify\" their opinion and lifestyle? \n\nSince it got a bit confusing, I'll leave TL;DR here: \n\nIf someone loves Trump and that is the only reason why anyone is free to hate them, that's fine. But then the same should apply to someone who hates a Muslim just because they are Muslim. \n\nThis topic might be a little controversial, but I kindly ask you to not go out of your way to write insulting things. Please only attack my opinion, don't attack me personally. Thank you for understanding.\n\nI'm ready to change my view.\n_____\n\n> *Hello, users of CMV! This is a footnote from your moderators.

Republicans often act as if this America was fantastic for everyone and happened because of the capitalist policies of the USA.\n\nBut I posit two things\n\n1 - 1950s America was horrible for almost anyone who wasn't a white male. Women were largely confined to homemaking and raising children. The small amount that did work did so in traditionally feminine roles such as teaching children and nursing. Segregation and Jim Crow Laws saw Ethnic Minorities treated as second class citizens who were given far fewer opportunities than white people.\n\n2 - The 1950s only existed due to relatively socialist practices.\n\n2 (i) - The New Deal saw a series of legislation introduced that helped regulate banks, create a more fluid currency, and helped the poor to find jobs. It also helped make sure what jobs people did get were able to support them.\n\n2 (ii) - The 1944 G.I. Bill saw veterans of the Second World War given unemployment benefits for the first year after returning from service while they enrolled in government subsidized trade schools and applied for low-interest loans.\n\nThese socialist practices were the basis that created an era of well-paying jobs, a generation of educated workers, and created the America that many Republicans I realize and wish to return to, but refuse to acknowledge as something that they would largely disagree with at the time.\n\nEdit - spelling and grammar\n\nEdit - My view has been changed.\n\nApparently Republicans only I realize the patriotism found in the 1950s, but prefer the economy of the 1980s.\n\nI now suggest that these two things are not reconcilable.",

            "selftext": "As of today the biggest news surrounding the Trump campaign is the \"release\" of his 1995 records, and a bit of evidence towards the speculation that he hasn't paid any income taxes in the past two decades. Obviously this has a huge negative spin, confirms a lot of the \"good business\" that is despicable to a large majority of voters. But I think could get ahead of the story and spin it to something in favor of his, and most traditional republicans, plans.\n\nThe simplify the tax code, reduce tax rates and eliminate loopholes to keep revenues up has been the bread and butter of the GOP for the last few elections, and Trump's plan isn't much different. Trump could come out strongly on the eliminating loopholes portion, citing the complete ineffectiveness of high tax rates on the wealthy if loopholes exist. \"I have many accountants, the best accountants, they do my taxes and find loopholes, all the loopholes, and I don't have to pay. I know lots of people and they all tell me the same thing.\" Just bringing up the fact that the current code, and Hillary's plan allows the rich to avoid taxes, while the middle class can't afford to do the same. Then mention how his plan would totally avoid it, and cut taxes on the middle class, and I think he could pick up some momentum.\n\nI don't expect this to happen, I think before my 3 hours here he will say something terrible, or some new scandal will pop up and Trump will continue to run his dumpster fire of a campaign, but I think this plan would help him, instead of drawing out his nonpayment of taxes till the election day or the next new evidence pops up.\n\nedit- Many comments are talking about the policy, and I am aware the issues of Trump's policy. What I am discussing, and what is sadly more important in politics is the narrative. Right now it is Trump is cheating taxes, he is doing a legal maneuver \"good business\" that reflects very poorly on him, I think he could change the perception.\n_____\n\n> *Hello, users of CMV!

I don\u2019t care about civil rights or gun nuts; I have bodyguards to protect me from inequality-driven rioting.\n\nLet\u2019s say all those above and this fair and just society nonsense don\u2019t add up to $2.5m for me. Aren\u2019t Republicans still bad for the economy overall? The market doesn\u2019t do as well under them. You can say it\u2019s mostly luck, but the frivolous wars Bush started that destroyed so much value were definitely rooted in Republican thinking\u2014not something a Democrat would do. Voodoo economics is known to be fiction, so any maneuvers in that direction will, by definition, have unintended consequences.\n\nTo me, it just doesn\u2019t seem worth it. I can save $2.5m off the bat, but under average market growth, I can make that back in a couple of years of Clinton or Obama at the helm. A few missteps by someone like Trump: one pointless war, botched trade deals that sour the dollar, or any of a dozen things he plans that can go wrong, and all that saved on taxes is wiped away.\n\nWe know reasonable presidents following Keynesianism get us about 10% a year. What am I missing that\u2019s making most people in my situation vote Trump? Do they think, in addition to the tax savings, he\u2019s going to do better than 10%? I\u2019m pretty conservative in my investment strategy, so I\u2019d rather have a guaranteed 10% than a risk of 20% or -10%. Are others hoping for a huge gain? Do they really think the unstable market he\u2019ll bring won\u2019t negate any tax savings he directly offers?\n\n_____\n\n> *Hello, users of CMV! This is a footnote from your moderators.

            "selftext": "One of the biggest issues for a number of redditors is the Trans Pacific Partnership.  I've read in any number of comments that people consider it the most important issue of the campaign, that it's the only issue that matters to some redditors, and that a vote for (Sanders/Trump/Stein) makes sense because of this one issue.\n\nPeople who feel this way are universally opposed to the TPP, and the general wisdom is that Clinton tacitly supports it - that her public statements opposing it are a lie.\n\nThis stance - Clinton is lying about the TPP - doesn't stand up to rational scrutiny, for reasons I will lay out.  Instead, it's an emotional reaction by people who dislike her personally, and who conflate their dislike of her with their opposition to the TPP.\n\n**1) The most common statement I hear is that Clinton \"will say anything to get elected.\"  Her opposition to the TPP, therefore, is nothing but a cynical move to bring reluctant Sanders supporters on board.**\n\nThis is nonsense.  If Clinton were willing to say anything, there's any number of things she could be saying that she isn't, all of which would appeal to more voters (including Sanders supporters) than the TPP, which 70% of voters have no opinion of at all.  For example, she could:\n\n* support Single Payer Healthcare, rather than her current plan of achieving universal healthcare through a public/private hybrid similar to the French and Dutch systems.\n\n* support free college tuition, rather than her current 'debt free' college plan, which caps at incomes of $125,000\n\n* adopt more isolationist rhetoric, like Bernie's\n\nShe hasn't done any of these things.  I don't see any reason that we should believe her apparent shift of positions on the TPP is calculated, if we can come up with a better or simpler explanation.\n\n**2) As evidence that she is lying, many on reddit point out that Clinton has changed positions on the TPP, that she was originally for it, until Sanders attacked her on it.  This is incorrect.**\n\nWhile Secretary of State, and crucially, while the TPP was incomplete and still being negotiated, she said she \"hoped it would be the gold standard\".  When the full text was released, she looked at the deal, and decided she couldn't support it.\n\nThis is 100% consistent with her record on free trade.  Unlike Sanders, Clinton supports free trade deals in some circumstances - they must have adequate protections for labor and the environment, for example.  She's supported some trade deals that she felt met that standard (like the US bilateral trade deal with Colombia) and opposed others that she felt did not (like CAFTA).\n\nThis is not inconsistent with her statements.  I would furthermore suggest that Sanders position - opposing the TPP before it was finished negotiating, then confirming his opposition mere hours after the text was released - is an intellectually dishonest one, and proves he never would have considered the TPP at all.\n\n**3) Clinton's supporters believe she will pass the TPP**\n\nIt depends who you talk to, and more importantly, if they have talked to Clinton.  Some say she will support it, other say she's against it.  Terry McAuliffe famously said she supported the TPP, but later (less famously) clarified that he hadn't spoken to her about it, and after he did, he stopped saying she supported it.\n\nTim Kaine supports the TPP, as does Barack Obama.  But trade deals are complicated and contentious issues, and absolutely one on which the Democratic Party is divided.  This is not evidence she tacitly supports it, but rather, evidence that she isn't willing to demonize everyone who disagrees with her on this topic.\n\nSo if you look at the weight of the evidence (actual evidence), we see that Clinton's opposition to the TPP is consistent with her voting record, while charges that she's lying are not.  I don't see a reasonable case to be made that she secretly supports the TPP.\n\nWhich is honestly disappointing for me, because I support the TPP.  I don't support Clinton because I think she tacitly supports it; I support her in spite of her opposition, which disappoints me.  I feel like her opposition emboldens the Sanders' anti-trade democrats, who I believe are wrong (and in opposition to science and evidence).\n\n**Lastly, a note about Correct the Record**.  Every pro-Clinton post on reddit is accused by at least one person of being a paid post by Correct the Record.  I am certain I will be accused of being a shill for making this post.  I can say that I'm not a paid shill (I'm not), but of course, that's just what a paid shill would say.\n\nSo instead, let me ask: what does it matter?  If I'm a shill or not, if you refute my arguments for all to see, you'll have struck a mighty blow against paid shills everywhere.  And if you fail to refute my arguments, then they're just as true as they would be if I weren't a shill (I'm not.)  So go ahead, and treat me like a shill, but respond to my arguments regardless.\n_____\n\n> *Hello, users of CMV! This is a footnote from your moderators.

He then self-deals from the foundation so that he still obtains the benefit of the income he earned without having paid income tax on it.\n\nThe combination of designation to his personally controlled foundation of what would be disallowed charitable deductions as well as extensive and repeated self-dealing from the foundation makes this appear extremely willful to me, and not merely an innocent error.\n\nSo does this legal case hold up?  Am I missing important precedents about how these sort of cases are prosecuted or what needs to be proven?  Is this evidence too flimsy to rely on?  \n\n---\n\n^1 This is not a crime, but it does inform later facts.  The basis for this is the well-known [1031 \"like kind\" exchange](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internal_Revenue_Code_section_1031) which would allow Trump to almost infinitely defer realizing gains on real estate holdings, while at the same time depreciating them.\n\n^2 [We know that he has received the STAR property tax reduction available only to people with incomes below $500,000 for 3 consecutive years recently.](http://www.usnews.com/news/business/articles/2016-03-09/trump-received-tax-credit-for-middle-class-taxpayers)\n\n^3 [We have good reason to believe that this is the case, and at least one donor has confirmed they did this.](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/trump-directed-23-million-owed-to-him-to-his-charity-instead/2016/09/26/7a9e9fac-8352-11e6-ac72-a29979381495_story.html)  \n\n Trump would be required to declare that money as income on his taxes, but would be permitted to deduct it as a charitable deduction, so long as that deduction did not exceed 50% of his taxable income. (or less depending, but we'll be charitable and give him the max 50%).\n\n^4 [Trump has used foundation money to settle lawsuits against his businesses and buy items for personal or business use.](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/trump-used-258000-from-his-charity-to-settle-legal-problems/2016/09/20/adc88f9c-7d11-11e6-ac8e-cf8e0dd91dc7_story.html?postshare=7751474381637324&tid=ss_tw)  We know one portrait of Trump which Trump's foundation bought is being hung [at one of his golf courses.](http://www.univision.com/univision-news/politics/how-i-found-trumps-controversial-10-000-portrait)  That's [definitely self dealing.](https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-tege/rr74-600.pdf)\n\nThe foundation has also [paid a penalty](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/post-politics/wp/2016/09/01/trump-pays-irs-a-penalty-for-his-foundation-violating-rules-with-gift-to-florida-attorney-general/) (reimbursed by Trump personally) for illegally donating to a 501(c)(4) PAC in what is [quite possibly an instance of quid-pro-quo bribery.](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2016/09/06/how-donald-trump-made-it-look-like-he-was-bribing-the-attorney-general-of-florida/)\n_____\n\n> *Hello, users of CMV!

            "selftext": "I raised a similar topic a month ago. It was a complete fiasco. But I did learn one thing: I was misplacing the focal point of my frustration. I can understand (while not excusing) the motivations behind the harmful actions of religious people. What I *cannot* understand is the apparent double standard displayed by non-Muslim defenders of Islam.\n\nThis topic began to preoccupy me when I became aware of a small but vocal population of *gay Trump supporters*. This confused the hell out of me. So I looked into it. What I saw in their arguments stunned me. They were in favor of Trump's plans to deny entry to Muslim immigrants. They didn't want more people in the country who believe homosexuality is immoral. They didn't want to be attacked for their sexuality. And they felt absolutely betrayed by the Left after the Orlando nightclub attack. No politicians on the left were daring to name Islam as the motivation for a bloody attack on a gay enclave. So their motivation was, 'If you won't defend us, we will turn to someone who says he will.' I think the downsides to Trump far outweigh any positives, and I don't even believe he could accomplish his 'Muslim ban' anyway. But I can fully empathize with these people's disillusionment and disgust. *'First you fight for our marriage rights, but then you won't speak out against a culture that wants us dead!?'* I can understand how someone could feel that so strongly it would send them to someone like Trump. I don't agree with the decision, but I can empathize.\n\nThinking about this led me to thinking about two of my dearest friends. Two men, married to one another. I even introduced them. They might be jailed or *murdered* in an Islamic state. I pictured their corpses. That mental image haunted me.\n\nAnd after thinking of that, I began to question *why* the Left is defending Islam. As I said, I posted a CMV about the topic. Most commenters did not respond by showing me positive aspects of Islam, but by personally attacking me for daring to condemn it. Their responses displayed no real understanding of Islam itself, but nonetheless they were defending it with the ferocity as if I'd insulted their own faith (or family). I brought up examples of commonly shared values in the Muslim world which are completely contrary to Western values. I was told, again and again, that it is wrong to condemn a religion, or members of that religion, for the actions of *some* in that religion.\n\nYet I see the same news media, and the same type of people who called me a bigot, condemning the Westboro Baptists for anti-gay bigotry. I have seen these same people send Duck Dynasty into a ratings tailspin after the patriarch said he was against gay marriage. I have seen these same people condemn faith-based gay 'conversion therapy'. I have seen them condemn Christian parents who disown their gay children. I have seen them condemn the Christian(and Mormon)-led attempts to prevent legalization of gay marriage in several US states. **Again and again, I have seen the American mainstream condemn Christianity for anti-homosexual views, yet display no consistent condemnation for the exact same behaviors in Islamic texts, culture, and citizens.**\n\n*That* is my frustration and *that* is what I want to understand. If there is a morally-consistent justification for this position, I can't see it. Someone please show me.\n\nWhy are Christians called bigots for condemning homosexuality, but *I* am called a bigot for condemning the exact same homophobic behaviors in a different religion?\n\n---\n\nFor consideration before you respond...\n\nAttitude towards homosexuality in the Muslim world: http://www.pewforum.org/files/2013/04/gsi2-chp3-6.png\n\nAttitude towards homosexuality among British Muslims: http://www.cnn.com/2016/04/11/europe/britain-muslims-survey\n\nAttitude towards homosexual marriage among American Muslims: https://d1ai9qtk9p41kl.cloudfront.net/assets/mc/_external/2016_06/poll.png?h=768&w=418 (I couldn't find a poll about homosexuality in general)\n\nAlso, look how deeply buried in this article you'll find the following sentence: *\"while a 2013 Pew Research poll found that 80 per cent of Canadians agreed that homosexuality should be accepted by society, only 36 per cent of Muslims agreed with that statement.\"* http://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/grenier-muslim-canadians-environics-1.3551591\n\n---\n\nFinally, I will be ignoring any attempts to try to change the subject from the actual topic to personal attacks against me for raising it. I am sick to death of people trying to shame me out of my position, instead of explaining/defending their own.\n\nhttp://www.pewforum.org/2013/04/30/the-worlds-muslims-religion-politics-society-morality/\n\n---\n\n**EDIT:** I think LiberalTerryN just hit the nail on the head: https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/5651b5/cmv_it_is_hypocritical_to_refuse_to_condemn/d8gh4di\n\n_____\n\n> *Hello, users of CMV!

His base has said repeatedly that there isn't much that Trump could say or do that will make them not vote for him. This needs to be respected. \n\nNow is not the time for polls and public outrage to impact the will of the people shown through votes. The GOP leadership should not pursue methods of removing him from the ticket simply because he has offended so many with this particular outburst. They should not pressure him to step down as the nomination. Nothing he said was really unexpected if folks had listened to his many interviews. This perhaps was more graphic, but was it more graphic than his statements that have offended other smaller groups? \n\nBy removing Trump, the GOP will have shown contempt for Republican and Independent voters who went to the ballot box. Trump received more votes than any other Republican primary candidate, [ever](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2016/06/08/donald-trump-got-the-most-votes-in-gop-primary-history-a-historic-number-of-people-voted-against-him-too/).

            "selftext": "Before I begin my argument, I'd like to preface it by saying I am not a Trump supporter.\n\nThe way I see it, the alt-right is, rather than simply the KKK revived, an alternative to mainstream Republican thought that still broadly maintains its \"right-wing\" nature. Republicans have, for a while now, been a psuedo-libertarian party (in an economic sense, certainly not a social one), attributing all problems to government being too powerful or taxes being too large. This justification for their policies has been said wherever \"mainstream\" American conservatism is preached. The \"alt-right\", however, derives it's \"alt\" status from the fact it disagrees with the conservative consensus and has a distinct ideology, that still can be called \"right-wing\". It prefers something in the vein of old Toryism; a powerful, paternalistic government, taking a stance in favor of its citizenry against external threats. \"External threats\" are not limited solely to foreigners, but things like poverty and crime, which the government can and should act against for the good of its populace. Moreover, the government exists to act for its own; it is not generous, as to be generous is to use resources that can be used to ensure a greater quality of life for its citizens for something that does not directly benefit its citizens, which is where its interests lie. It's roughly akin to a lawyer; if you're in court against someone, you expect your lawyer to advocate your case to their upmost ability within the confines of the law, even if the other side is a human being and has interests that need attention. Caring about them is their lawyer's (government's) job, not yours.\n\nSure, there's a fair bunch of trolls and people who might not have the most benevolent thoughts on race relations under this umbrella, and Trump, the candidate they're rallying behind, has policies in reality more in line with the GOP economically liberal stance than the economically interventionist, safety net-building approach that a \"selfish government\" would probably have, but Trump's rhetoric advocates that sort of look at the nature of government in a way that the American right-wing hasn't for decades, and I think it can be transformed into something very positive for the nation; a government that genuinely acts in favor of its citizenry, rather than for \"the common good\", as Democrats seem to prefer, or that doesn't act/acts in favor of the kyriarchy, as Republicans seem to prefer, is something I think genuinely deserves attention, and the \"alt-right\" is the force that can bring it attention.",

Is this the best one of the richest, largest, most educated and advanced countries can offer? Two rotten, hated, wealthy figures? One who's clearly broken the law multiple times and been exempt from facing justice. And someone who runs on around zero clear policies other than vague variations of racism, against the establishment ideals, a nice hairstyle and funny one liners? \n\nAs the large wealth gap levels down the entry bar for running as a politician would be a lot lower and this would allow for a wider array of educated and capable citizens to lead the country as political discussion and whatnot is encouraged, Unions gaining power give more traction to leftist movements creating more education focused leaders therefore leaving us all with a smarter, happier, richer and overall better society. And therefore a world as a whole.\n\nPlus we'd get to call each other \"comrades\", own Mosin Nagants and ushankas would come back in fashion. \nCMV!

            "selftext": "I'm putting this view forward as food for thought based on my observations the past couple of years. \n\nIt seems to me that in the public-relations obsessed political culture of the UK and the USA being a female politician comes with a particular set of advantages and they relate to the way male politicians are scrutinised by the media and the electorate. Now female politicians do get scrutinised too particularly for their appearance and some aspects of their personal lives but I don't perceive this as being as deal-braking as the judgements male politicians can be subject too. \n\nWith Teresa May, the new PM of the UK, and Hillary Clinton, presidential candidate in the US both polling highly against their male opponents I think the current situation helps highlight the factors working against male political figures: \n\n* Male politicians find themselves caught between two conflicting expectations. This is the result of relatively recent developments in our culture, which concurrently holds two ideas of what men should be like, the 'Traditional Man' and the 'New Man'. One or other of these ideals can be held by separate demographics as well as both being held by the same person.  \n\n* The 'Traditional Man' must be perceived as being 'macho' by many among electorate who hold to traditional gender values. So strong and dominant. This however, may work against them as they could come off as too arrogant or brazen. Trump is a perfect case example for this ideal in action. His 'jock' personality and loud, reckless demeanour are admired by his most ardent supporters, however, as the leaked tapes have revealed these same traits have alienated many and he comes off as a major douche-bag and not a president. \n\n* The 'New Man' is the sensitive, nice, compassionate ideal that more aligns with the values of modern society. However a male politician must tread carefully as not to be seen as 'too nice' as he could then be labelled weak. For some 'too nice' might mean not being 'macho', simple as that. Not being alpha means your a beta. In the UK Corbyn is often dismissed as being weak by members of the electorate for his unabrasiveness. Before him, Milliband was crucified by the media and the electorate for being a 'geek' with 'nothing about him'. \n\n* With the media culture and the electorate choosing to both vilify male politicians who are are 'too arrogant' and humiliate male politicians who are 'too nice' this leaves a very narrow line for men in the political sphere to follow which could risk them falling into the category 'too bland'. It seems in this climate the safest bet for political parties seeking government are female candidates as they can be put forward as nice, kind and attentive without failing to 'measure up'. \n\n* As such, typical women politicians can appeal to traditionalists, most of whom are progressive enough to accept female leaders, as they still honour gender expectations and appeal to progressives for being pioneers first of all and more compassionate, sensitive leaders secondly. Not that they really are that but they can convince enough people while their male opponents are being destroyed. \n\nSo for the time being I hold the view that for as long as the expectations of male leaders remain ambiguous and our media opportunistically pounces on any failure to 'measure up', any female politician would do well to make her move further up the pecking order. There are simply less ways for a woman to fall down than a man in this current political atmosphere, in the UK, where I'm from, or the USA. \n\nFinally I would like to add that I hold nothing against having more female politicians and they being more successful, indeed I see it a good thing and personally would rather see a parliament full of them than full of the Old Boy's Club we're only just shaking off. \n\nThank you for reading and leave you opinions in the receptacle below.  \n\nTL,DR: There isn't one, put the effort in as I have and read at least the bullet points to understand my view.  \n\nEdit: Spelling and grammar.

            "selftext": "I think Trump bombed the first debate, but blew the second far worse, especially considering the stakes. I felt Trump tied or even beat Clinton in the first third of the 1st presidential debate (on the economy), but decisively lost the last 2/3ds. I gave Clinton around a B- for the first debate, and Trump a D-. (For reference, I gave Tim Kaine a C- in the VP Debate, and Mike Pence a B/B+). For the second debate though, I'm giving Clinton a solid A and Trump a solid F. \n\nI honestly think most of the CNN pundits saying he did well are being highly delusional. Or maybe they think that because the expectations for him were so low and he was graded on a curve. Yes, he didn't completely fall apart but that doesn't mean he did well. He really did nothing to help his candidacy, and is still losing. Clinton also effectively needled Trump for elite Republicans\u2019 abandonment of his campaign in the wake of the tape. \n\nI think this is where Trump's whole-in-the-ground expectations come into play. I would say Clinton won, by a tighter margin. She remained cool and composed, was measured and articulate like Pence, while Trump was very rambling, and often avoided questions and got way off script. The moderators held his feet to the fire to make him answer questions directly, and he make himself look boorish and unprofessional by arguing with Cooper so much, and interrupting Clinton, which she handled with tact. \n\nTrump was worse than McCain in 2008 with regards to his body language with wandering around the stage, and seeming to hover behind Clinton is not a good look for him. He interrupted, was nasty, and complained incessantly about his speaking time. \n\nI think he came off as a jumbled, angry, nervous mess consistently, although his worst performance was in the first 40 minutes over the sexual assault allegations. Trump accused the other nominee's spouse of rape, threatened to jail his opponent if he wins the election, and espoused conspiracy theory after conspiracy theory, which the moderators partly called him out for, and which he'll be eviscerated for by fact-checkers in the coming days. And yet, some in the media are calling it draw because he literally didn't light himself on fire. \n\nI thought Clinton explained away the \"public vs private\" position well with by placing it into context (the Lincoln movie), and killed that issue dead in its tracks. Trump came off as unhinged and awkward. Clinton displayed effective political ju-jitsu by pivoting from the WikiLeaks dump to the its source, Russian government hackers who back Trump's candidacy, and relevantly hitting Trump on his pro-Kremlin rhetoric. \n\nOn taxes, he was a mess accusing Clinton over and over with not closing carried-interest, which she dispatched his comment relatively quickly and listing her detailed tax policy. She clarified Trump's plan would increase middle-class taxes, and she wouldn't raise taxes at all on households making $250,000 a year or less. She professionally apologized and took responsibility for the e-mails, while Trump didn't apologize for anything, making him look petty and immature. She articulately defended her 30-year old record and hashed out exactly what she's accomplished (CHIP, healthcare for 9/11 first responders, nuclear disarmament with Russia as SoS, etc.), and then laid out her specific plans for the future. \n\nAlmost every time Trump was cut off, it was in the middle of a drunken-uncle-on-Facebook-esque alt-right rant that was unrelated to the question. At least when Clinton got cut off, it was because she was getting into the weeds of her policies. \n\nFor Trump, I think it was more or less the same stream of consciousness he had last time. Maybe a little tighter but not by much. Clinton's a far better speaker. The visual optics favored her and she looked Presidential and calm, and didn't interrupt him. She didn't control the tone and tenor of the debate, but I think it's best she was restrained instead of attacking Trump more directly. He dug himself in a ditch and got called out by the moderators. She didn't engage in most of the attacks against her, which meant they were in the middle of a long, rambling rant of Trump's and quickly forgotten. \n\nHe was just nervous and angry and awkward, trafficking in hot-air answers. He wasn't as big of a disaster as people thought, and maybe that's why they're praising him. She's done a lot of town halls so her strong performance was to be expected and she actually looked the audience members in the eye and answered their questions directly. \n\nShe looked relaxed, smiled a lot,and laughed a lot (mostly at Trump's awkward attacks). She spoke intelligently and with details. He just looked psychotic, especially when he kept weirdly and randomly name-dropping Bernie Sanders. There's a part of me that is actually amazed at the lack of respect for Clinton's ability to debate, because even her \"canned\" answers knocked Trump out of it before ten minutes had passed. \n\nLast night Donald Trump said: \n\n- He hasn't paid federal taxes in 20 years \n- As president, he will personally pick a judge to prosecute and put Clinton in jail \n- Called Clinton a rape enabler, and Bill Clinton a rapist \n- Doubled down on the \"locker room talk\" excuse \n- Stated he had never done anything like he said on the sexual assault tape. Was condescending and aggressive about the tape, and proceeded to talk over Clinton and made no case for himself \n- Went on rant after rant never answering the question that was asked \n- Got completely lost time after time \n- Continued to display plenty of hyperbole and alt-right anti-Clintonianism, and was very cold to the Muslim woman who asked about Islamophobia \n- Did nothing to reassure women, people of color, or Muslims \n- Sided with Russia and Iran on Syria and explicitly threw his VP pick, Mike Pence, under the bus on the topic \n- Admitted he doesn't really talk with his VP pick that much \n- Admitted he didn't know anything about Russia \n- Had no idea about the legislative process and system of checks and balances (like wrt the carried interest tax loophole) \n- Displayed his sheer lock of policy knowledge and foreign affairs, especially wrt the Syrian conflict \n- Clinton had specific policy plans while Trump ranted about how horrible Clinton was and offering no real plans on his own \n- Pointed like a petulant child saying Clinton's a disgrace and called her \"the devil,\" saying she \"has hate in her heart\" \n- Had no self-awareness \n- accused the moderators of conspiring against him (\u201cthat\u2019s three to one\u201d) \n\nTrump had tons of embarrassing gaffes as well, such as \"perhaps there was no hacking at all,\" \"I don't know anything about Russia, etc. When asked about Aleppo, Trump talked for two minutes about random shits, and Raddatz had to call him out and repeat the question. \n\nThese statements will be the real legacy of the debate. They can all be translated into sound bites and quick clips that will be on the morning shows and attack ads. Fact-checkers at NYT, CBS, PolitiFact, NPR, WaPo, etc., have already decimated Trump on the substance, and his incongruities, blatantly false statements, and ridiculous assertions will dominate the news cycle. It\u2019s hard to find anything Trump said that wasn\u2019t either a lie or highly misleading. Moreover, early polling shows that voters feel Clinton had her decisive victory against Trump. The news cycle is already being very positive for Clinton due to the substance of her attacks on Trump\u2019s policy holding weight. \n\nThis election is over. We need to get used to saying \"Madam President.\" According to an NBC News/Wall Street Journal poll released today, Hillary Clinton has opened up a 14-percentage-point lead against Donald Trump nationally. In a four-way race involving third-party candidates, Clinton leads Trump by 11 percentage points. True, this poll was conducted after Trump's sexual assault tape and before last night's debate. By not completely imploding, Trump may have stanched the bleeding somewhat. But with early polls indicating that voters felt Clinton solidly won the second debate, Trump's extremely unlikely to gain much ground. \n\nThe question now isn't whether Clinton will win, it's whether she can preserve or even expand her commanding lead. As of now, Democrats are set to win both the presidency and U.S. Senate, but Republicans are very, very likely to retain control of the House. But remember, a double-digit win in the presidential popular vote is approximately what Clinton needs for her coattails to be strong enough to flip control of the House to Democrats. \n\nThe worst contrasts where when Clinton answered the Muslim girl vs Trump (her \"stronger together\" message, saying she wants to create an America where everyone feels like they belong), and the question about who is a better role model for youth. Trump came off as a dangerous demagogue while Clinton came off as very presidential, professional, and inclusive. Trump's strategy was literally. deflect, insult, interrupt, negative barb, sensationalize, and sniff loudly. \n\nTo me Clinton remained calm. Trump went all over. To me she seemed more presidential, prepared, knowledgeable, positive, and uplifting. While Trump was negative and evasive. \n\nTrump looked completely out of his depth in places to the point where the moderators had to jump in and force him to answer a question specifically or tell him he was just wrong (announcing battle plans as psychological warfare and/or as a warning to civilians to get out). He said some absurd things (Captain Khan would be alive). He lied about saying he opposed the Iraq War and was called out on it. He was all over the place in most of the questions (Alicia Machado to Benghazi in seven seconds; the Supreme Court question ended with him challenging Hillary to donate $30 million to hersel!!?). I think he brought Paula Jones et al assuming that Hillary would take the bait like he did with Machado and didn't really have a plan B for them. \n\nOne thing I've noticed about Clinton is she will rarely directly go after Trump, even when given the opportunity. She makes it about his temperament, judgment, or policies. She is so even and calm I think it plays well against someone like Trump. I think she made a strategic effort to focus on the issues. Trying to correct all of Trump's lies would have taken too much time. I applaud her for remaining above the fray. She looked at the audience often and engaged with them while Trump was just sniffling away. Clinton had far better answers on unifying the country. \n\nClinton did give great policy statements, too. I really liked her response to the question on energy policy. She acknowledged the security benefits of energy independence, while promoting renewable, clean energy sources and addressing climate change. Clinton displayed a mastery of policy, facts, and logic. I liked her answer on using national gas to transition to renewable energy, and how she'll help coal country adapt. Trump's response on energy was awful substance-wise. \n\nWhatever her flaws, I think Clinton has shown an impressive command of policy in the debates. Every single time Trump litigated the fact that Clinton has been in Washington for 30 years and somehow all our problems aren't gone, he displayed his awful, fundamental misunderstanding of how the federal government works. U.S. Senators don't have autocratic power. And we've been in divided government for the past 30+ years. \n\nI think Trump came off as a petulant, tantrum-throwing child while Clinton came across as professional and even likable (something she's often failed to do. Like, I thought she was nervous and robotic in the first debate, whereas she was pretty calm and confident last night).\n",

I did not ever think Johnson's use of language was equally as bad as the trump video - my view has been change to consider the use of language not as important as I once thought it was but people seemed to think I thought they were both equally problematic.\n\n2. people seem to think I am a sexist person somehow - I'm going to blame this on my lack of proofreading before I submitted the post in the first place but I really don't think I am - If someone wants to PM me and explain why I'm sexist please go ahead and let me know!\n\n3. The use of fiscal conservative has come up a lot... I need to look into the proper definition but for the purposes of this post I meant I tend to side with democrats on social issues (pro choice, less foreign intervention, more gun control), and with republicans economically (less taxation, less regulation for industry, free-er trade)\n\nand finally, thanks everyone for changing my view!\n\n---\n\nI currently have my ballot sitting in my email inbox (I'm voting from abroad), and while this is the first time I am old enough to vote in the election, there isn't anyone that I can comfortably vote for, especially when we take into account treatment of women (as a woman myself). When I say there isn't anyone, I mean I can't vote for Trump, Clinton, or even Gary Johnson (despite the fact that 3rd parties never win anyway). \n\n\nI don't live in a swing state, so my vote is more of a symbolic vote for myself than anything. I was looking forward to being able to vote for the first time for a very long time, so this is disappointing to me feeling like there is no one to vote for. Obviously the news and campaigns has been very negative about everybody, so I'm really just looking for someone to convince me to see *any* of the candidates in a positive light, and I will count that as a view changed. Give me someone to vote for!\n\n\nonto why I think they're all terrible:\n\n\n**TRUMP**: while I would see myself as a fiscal conservative and would probably vote republican any other election, I think the reasons he isn't a choice right now is pretty obvious. While I don't think he is as much a \"hitler\" as the news and everybody on facebook would have me believe, I don't think I can vote for him as president. I think his plan for bringing work into the country is actually kind of interesting, but obviously his treatment of women has been absolutely awful, and his build a wall thing and the extreme vetting is insane.\n\n\n**CLINTON**: again, while a fiscal conservative, socially I'm more progressive and in terms of economics I *think* hillary is more central than many democrats so ideologically I would be open to voting for her. However, in so many ways she is just awful. Obviously there was the entire email scandal, which bothers me that someone can be so lackadaisical with classified information. She flip flops a lot, so I don't feel comfortable with her saying she wont support TPP, because I think she certainly might. She is very pro war for a democrat and this is something in particular I don't like - I would rather we stop fiddling with the stability of foreign nations. But in terms of treatment of women, I think she is also a poor choice. I am certainly not against having a woman president (I absolutely LOVE theresa may, for example) - but I think her as the first woman president would be sad in a lot of ways. For one, she stayed with her husband after he cheated on her in a very public fashion, and while that is obviously her choice, and shouldn't affect my vote, the way she treated those other women does. She was quite active in dragging those other women through the dirt, when Bill is the one who should have known better. There are a few other reasons on top of this both in terms of treatment of women and Hillary as a politician that are stopping me from voting for her, but I'll leave it at this for now. Ideologically though I can Identify with many of her plans so I am open to being convinced.\n\nand finally\n**JOHNSON**: One the one hand, a little bit useless (read: \"What is a leppo?\"). and on top of that, called Trump a \"pussy\", which obviously, using any form of genitalia as an insult goes against proper treatment of both genders. so its a no go there.\n\nChange my view please!\n\n_____\n\n> *Hello, users of CMV!

            "selftext": "I will admit, McCain endorsing Trump after Trump's comments about his POW status was off-putting and took away from respect I had for the senator.\n\n> \u201cHe\u2019s not a war hero,\u201d said Trump. \u201cHe was a war hero because he was captured. I like people who weren\u2019t captured.\u201d\n\nHowever, I feel like McCain explained himself incredibly well in his endorsement-withdrawal statement on Saturday.\n\n> I have wanted to support the candidate our party nominated. He was not my choice, but as a past nominee, I thought it was important I respect the fact that Donald Trump won a majority of the delegates by the rules our party set. I thought I owed his supporters that deference.\n\nAmerica is a democracy, and both parties open up the political process to decide the candidate. To not endorse the nominee of the party, McCain would have been turning his nose up to a majority of Republican primary voters. I actually respect that McCain deferred to the voters, despite strong disagreements (as noted in his statement of withdrawal)\n\nHowever, a withdrawal of endorsement doesn't seem to be enough for many. I've taken a comment from a popular comment section of a McCain story that is rather representative of what I'm seeing across many political subreddits.\n\n> Fuck that. He supported him when he wanted to bring back waterboarding 'and worse' as well as killing the children of terrorists to get at their morale.\n\n> Fuck this guy. He's just NOW backing away from Trump.\n\n> Don't let any of these poison pill partisans off the hook.\n\nThis isn't even entirely accurate. Sure, McCain didn't withdraw his support after Trump's stance on torture was clear, *but* he did publicly speak on the floor of the Senate against any torture policy. A stronger statement, in my opinion, to openly propose why you disagree with your nominee.\n\nThe title of my post summarizes my view. I don't believe McCain deserves the flak he is receiving for his late revocation of his endorsement of Trump. CMV.\n_____\n\n> *Hello, users of CMV! This is a footnote from your moderators.

            "selftext": "This is my first CMV post so forgive me if it all falls apart but I will do my best. \n\nA number of factors can be attributed to Britain's (IMO) inherently wrong decision to leave the EU. The message was mis-communicated, there was ugliness from politicians on both sides and the UK is seeing a lot of the immediate consequences of that decision already. One factor largely attributed to this decision was voter turnout.\n\nDespite being the 'largest mandate ever' for a parliamentary vote, it is a widely known fact that voter turnout out was greater amongst the older generation who overwhelmingly voted to leave the European Union. This was compared with young people who despite being more pro EU were less likely to turnout and vote. Overall just over 20% of people who were eligible to vote in the EU referendum did not exercise their right.  \n\nNow I am no psychologist but it will probably not come as much of a surprise to anyone reading this that a lot of voting behaviour is based on emotion. Namely, it is often anger, anxiety, fear or pride that may persuade someone to vote in a certain way. There can be many parallels drawn between Brexit and the US elections. Namely efforts of one side of the debate to use fear, anxiety and national pride to try and persuade public opinion. As with Brexit, there also seems to be a lot of negativity flying around Hilary Clinton and her character though evidently being by far the safer and more logical option on paper. Worse still, people are so disappointed with the US elections (as some were in the U.K.) that they are willing not to vote at all. \n\nNow my view: I can foresee Donald Trump winning this election, not because America truly believes he is the better candidate but because people who are like him are more likely to get out and vote for him (I have no stats to support this). People who will not vote at all are supporting his campaign as the vitriol surrounding Hilary Clinton who on paper is the obvious choice of candidate will mean that votes that could have supported her are being cast by people who like Trump. \n\nI appreciate that this argument could be said both ways but looking through a BBC news comment section prior to Brexit is very similar to what I see under a Donald Trump headline. \n\nI would love my view to be changed on this as I believe that democracy can and should work but only if everyone else has their say. \n\nBiased sources: \n\nhttp://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2016/06/24/how-did-turnout-affect-the-eu-referendum-result/\n\nhttps://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voting_behavior\n\nhttp://www.vanityfair.com/news/2010/03/fear-and-loathing-well-anger-actually-in-voting-patterns\n\nEdit: \n\nThank you everyone for the comments, I am looking forward to being a more active member of this sub. One extra point for clarification:\n\n I have no data to clarify this but it would seem to me that Trump's following amongst right and far right supporters is more likely to get him votes (though his loss amongst centre right voters may nullify this gain somewhat). In comparison despite her mandate appearing to be exceptionally large, it is less clear to me just how much support Hilary has amongst the left and far left (who would have elected Bernie Sanders) compared with the centre left (and those republicans who have said they would vote Democrat on this occasion). Again I have no data to back up my observations here, I just think people on the right in this election are more likely to just get up and vote Trump compared to Hilary. ",

            "selftext": "I've spent some time researching on both Trump and Hillary. I completely understand the hatred for Trump. Everything that we've been taught to detest and rightly reject; Racism, Sexism, Bigotry and general misdemeanour; Trump is guilty of.\n\nBut I can't help but think that HRC is the quickest path to something worse than all of those things which is WW3.\n\nI believe this conflict in Syria has spiralled into a situation in which we're essentially funding radical terrorists to overthrow a stable government. \n\nI've searched for any kind of proof that Assad used chemical weapons as if that justifies the actions of these 'moderate' terrorists, but all I find is evidence they were perpetrated by the rebels themselves.\n\nBesides if we're so concerned about human rights, why haven't we intervened in say; North Korea? In North Korea there has been general knowledge of a slow holocaust of it's population for years now.\n\nNow that Russia has become involved, and doesn't seem to be backing down with regards to Syria, I feel we need to de-escalate the situation as fast as possible.\n\nHRC seems intent to establish no fly zones and further escalate the situation. She appears to want to further prod Russia with a sharp stick. This I think will lead to some very big problems. Problems that will make Trump's talk of grasping female genitalia laughable in comparison.\n\nEither HRC doesn't KNOW of the danger she's inviting, or worse still; She knows but she simply doesn't care. \n\nPerhaps I'm mixing two very large issues; The election, and WW3. But I feel like it's the big issue that's going to swing my support of Hillary to Trump. Trumps relationship with Putin might be in the right direction to de-escalate our presence in Syria and avert WW3 for the time being. Despite his remarks of \"If we have nukes why don't we use them\".\n\nThe inspiration for this post comes after watching this:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dkamZg68jpk\n\nIt's a bit tin-foil hat at the end. But as a metaphor: if a mind control device ever WAS used; Would we all be in danger because we're so used to laughing at tin foil hats?\n \n\n\n\n\n\n_____\n\n> *Hello, users of CMV!

            "selftext": "I don't think Donald Trump was bragging about getting away with sexual assault in the Access Hollywood tapes.  First of all, yes, of course it is sexual assault to grab a woman's genitalia without their consent.  But it is not sexual assault if it's consensual.  And that's what Donald Trump is bragging about in the tape.  For reference, here's the transcript of the relevant portion:\n\nTrump: Yeah, that\u2019s her. With the gold. I better use some Tic Tacs just in case I start kissing her. You know I\u2019m automatically attracted to beautiful - I just start kissing them. It\u2019s like a magnet. Just kiss. I don\u2019t even wait.\n\nAnd when you\u2019re a star **they let you do it.** You can do anything.\n\nBush: Whatever you want.\n\nTrump: Grab them by the p****. You can do anything.\n\nI've bolded the phrase \"they let you do it\" because that's a reference to consent, with \"they\" referring to the woman on the receiving end of his actions.  Trump is not bragging about his wealth and fame allowing him to get away with groping women without their consent, which, again, absolutely would be sexual assault.  He is instead bragging that his wealth and his fame make him so sexually attractive to women that they consent to being groped by him.  And that's why he and his defenders are so insistent on it being \"locker room talk.\"  Because while bragging about sexual assault is not normal in locker rooms, outlandish claims about one's sexual attractiveness and prowess absolutely are.\n\nAnd just to be clear, I'm not defending Trump here.  I think that Trump did not brag about sexual assault in the tapes, but I'm not saying that if he did what he said he did, those women actually did consent.  In fact, given the stories from the women who have come forward so far, I think it's likely that they did not.  And I think the takeaway of my view - Trump believes he was bragging about consensual sexual activity - is that Trump doesn't truly understand what consent is, and that might actually be even worse.  But it's worse in a way that underlines just how deeply rooted misogyny is and that can't be dismissed as \"Trump's a sociopath and an aberration.\"\n_____\n\n> *Hello, users of CMV!

            "selftext": "First off, I just want to put out a disclaimer. I think Trump is an abomination -- and that he would be an absolutely horrible choice for President. I also believe that anyone who actively supports him is lacking in judgment on several levels. \n\nSo I'd like to take Trump out of the equation here entirely and focus strictly on Hillary.\n\nWhat's so bad about her? Any time I ask this question I get a whirlwind of nonsensical responses from Trump supporters who often just make shit up and attribute fault where it doesn't exist.\n\nI want to know what the real-life, hard evidence shows. Why is she such a terrible choice? What makes her ill-fitting for the Presidency?\n\nEdit: Outlining my current view:\n\nI personally don't see the big deal. I don't see why she's as terrible as people say. It's hard to argue why exactly because it'd be like proving a negative. I simply don't see the compelling evidence to suggest that she is a terrible choice. The emails are brought up often, but I don't understand why this makes her a bad choice in the sense that a lot of politicians have deleted emails (GWB, Romney, etc) and yet we don't hear a peep over that. So to me it comes across as selective outrage. \n\nI don't believe she used her email server out of malice -- I think she was just negligent for the sake of technological convenience, even if it was a questionable choice and a little careless. I am not aware of anyone being seriously hurt or damaged as a result of the emails.\n\nI also don't buy the Benghazi argument, because that seemed like a fault of the system rather than any one person in particular. It puzzles me why people lay the blame for that at Hillary's feet when just months prior they were blaming Obama for the same mess.\n\nIf anything, I think she has a long track record and she seems just as competent as any other, as far as I can tell. She was involved in a scandal but that was more Bill Clinton's thing, and I think it's wrong to blame Hillary for Bill's actions.\n\nShe seems fairly aligned with Obama politically, and according to ISideWith.com, pretty close to Bernie too, and a lot of people seemed to like him. So I don't understand why they suddenly flip when it comes to Hillary.\n\n\n_____\n\n> *Hello, users of CMV! This is a footnote from your moderators.

            "selftext": "The Republican and Democratic parties have pigeonholed voters. [42% of people are independent voters](http://www.gallup.com/poll/166763/record-high-americans-identify-independents.aspx) whose views are not in strict alignment with either party's platforms. [A third party candidate actually has higher support than Clinton or Trump among independent voters in some polls](http://www.nbcnews.com/storyline/data-points/poll-how-third-party-candidates-could-affect-2016-race-n648266).  \n\nOfficially, the [Commission on Presidential Debates (CPD)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commission_on_Presidential_Debates) is non-partisan. Upon closer inspection, though, the organization has failed its non-partisan mission. Currently, [candidates outside of the Republican and Democratic parties must obtain 15% approval in 5 national polls to qualify for inclusion](http://www.debates.org/index.php?page=overview), which may sound reasonable, but is an arbitrary metric that limits voters to only seeing debates between tickets in the major parties.  \n\nIn order for a third party candidate to even hope for 15%, they would have to have a massive amount of name recognition before ever announcing their candidacy. Even then, it likely will not work. Donald Trump himself could not get into the debates as a third party candidate in the 2000 election, and he is a nominee for president. [He also agrees that 15% is too high, along with Bernie Sanders.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzUKTNJuqhg&feature=youtube_gdata_player)   \n\nThe national polls used for the inclusion criteria [have inherent bias as well](http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2012/05/survey_bias_how_can_we_trust_opinion_polls_when_so_few_people_respond_.html). Even if the most honest team in the world were conducting them, [there would still be a margin of error because every voter in the country cannot be polled](http://www.rasmussenreports.com/public_content/politics/general_politics/may_2015/most_voters_expect_biased_news_coverage_of_2016_presidential_race); however, if this election has shown us anything, the national polls are anything but honest. [A recent CNN poll excluded ages 18-34 from their polls entirely](http://i2.cdn.turner.com/cnn/2016/images/09/05/rel13a.-.2016.post-labor.day.pdf)(page 22 of the report). One of the largest demographics in the country totally left out.  \n\nYour response to all of this may be \u201cThird party candidates are nothing but conspiracy theorists and oddballs. We do not need them on the stage anyway.\u201d Many of them may be odd, but third parties also gave us candidates like Teddy Roosevelt, Ralph Nader, and [Victoria Woodhull](http://www.history.com/news/9-things-you-should-know-about-victoria-woodhull), the first female candidate for president in 1870. Limiting American politics to only Republican and Democratic viewpoints is not just ignorant, it is dangerous to all of us. Put plainly, it severely limits our choices by only allowing only a narrow set of ideas and policies.  \n\nWhat is a fair metric for inclusion in the debates? [I would argue the laws that are already on the books for ballot access are a fair place to start](https://ballotpedia.org/Ballot_access_for_presidential_candidates). States set up ballot access laws to be tough for a reason: it excludes candidates who do not have the support necessary to run a serious campaign. For example, in most states, third party candidates must have a minimum of 5,000 valid signatures to qualify. This number is very difficult to obtain. Volunteers to collect these signatures must dedicate hundreds of hours, and our ballot access criterion is not even the most rigorous among all states.  \n\nIn fact, there is only one ticket outside the Republican and Democratic parties that made it on every state ballot this year out of the dozens of third parties vying for the presidency: [Gary Johnson and Bill Weld](https://www.johnsonweld.com), of the [Libertarian Party](http://http://www.lp.org/). The only other third party ticket that came close was [Jill Stein](http://jill2016.com/) of the [Green Party](http://www.gp.org/) who is on the ballot in 45 states.\n\nMillions of Americans signed ballot access petitions, volunteered, and were polled to be in favor of including these candidates as a choice on their ballots, but the system failed them by limiting their choice. The CPD has a virtual monopoly on debate inclusion that hurts voters.\n\nEDIT: corrected 18-24 to **18-34** for the CNN poll.\n_____\n\n> *Hello, users of CMV!

            "selftext": "1.5-2 years ago most political experts/analysts predicted that 2016 will be Hillary vs. Jeb Bush. Most predicted that Hillary certainly will be the Dem candidate and that she will most likely win because\n\n1. She is more prepared than anyone else. She spend years, if not decades preparing for this and already tried to get the nomination in 2008. She has a large network of donors and an extensive ground game. Plus a lot of support from celebrities and influential people.\n\n2. The US is changing from a mainly white Christian country to a more racially, religiously and sexually diverse country. The Republicans are mainly strong with whites, especially Christian men whereas the Democrats are strong with blacks, Hispanics, educated whites, women, other religions and LGBT. Therefore the odds are against any Republican, especially if their candidate fails to convince other/new demographics.\n\n3. The Republicans have a large share of far right wingers that push their candidate towards the right and away from the center. That makes is hard to win the general election because the Republican candidate has to position himself relative far right to win the primaries and then either shift his position to the center, which means losing credibility and upsetting far right Republicans, or remain relatively far right, which means losing a lot of centrists/independents to the Dem candidate. \n\nSo the only thing that really changed is that instead of Jeb Bush being pushed to the right, it was actually a far right wing candidate (Trump) that won the primaries. Everything else happened exactly as predicted.\n\n1. Hillary won the primaries not because she was extremely popular but because she prepared better than anyone else and basically had the party behind her after years of lobbying and she could mobilize the voters she needed. This advantage continues in the general election, her ground game is far better than Trump's and she can spend more money. She is also far better prepared for pretty much anything (e.g. debates, scandals...). It's basically the small differences that add up and give her a lead.\n\n2. Hillary is also leading because she does well with all minorities and women and, as widely predicted, the Republican candidate is struggling and losing because he can't convince enough people outside the typical Republican voter groups.\n\n3. The only real surprise is that instead of an establishment candidate (like Bush) this time the far right wing candidate won the primaries. However, I think even this victory is overrated. Trump didn't win a 1 on 1 vs. a main stream candidate but rather the rest of the party failed to unite behind one \"anti Trump\" candidate until it was too late. He basically won by \"divide and conquer\", not by popularity. He had the biggest minority, not really the majority. I think he is one of the most unpopular candidates within the Rep party. However, Trump isn't really different from what was predicted. It basically just shows that the far right wing drift of the Rep party is a bit strong than everyone thought, but the effect is the standard the \"Rep candidate is being pushed too far to the right by his own party to win the GE\" situation everyone predicted.\n\nOverall, I don't think the outcome and process is much different from what everyone expected. Hillary will win, as predicted, and the Rep will lose for the predicted reasons. If anything the (likely) clear defeat of Trump proofs that the predictions were correct about the trends and their results. If anything the outcome was clearer than expected.\n\nFor other themes the media often states as extraordinary in the 2016 election I think they are mainly irrelevant or not that extraordinary. E.g. US politics is full of sex scandals. Ironically, Bill Clinton actually proofs that. And other presidential candidates lost because of sex scandals before. Also Trumps populism isn't that unusual either, it's similar to the European far right wing rhetoric. I guess you could claim that it's extraordinary that he behaves like a reality TV show clown but I don't think that's too relevant and there is a general trend towards sensationalism anyway. Also if you go back in history then other candidates actually did make crazy claims too (e.g. that elections were rigged, unfairly attacking the other candidate, over 1000 psychologists declared Berry Goldwater as mentally unfit for president...). Also everyone is ignoring that there we hardly heard any extremely religious rhetoric, which is actually one of the few things that I find pretty surprising about the 2016 election considering how deeply religious large parts of US are. \n\nEDIT. Please no claims like \"Trump isn't losing, this one poll/unscientific polls shows otherwise\".\n\n_____\n\n> *Hello, users of CMV! This is a footnote from your moderators.

However, she hasn't reiterated any of these controversial and conservative opinions during this election, and not even the recent years before the election. I believe politicians, just like everyone else, can change their mind and opinion, and I find it stupid that what's stopping a lot of liberals and even moderates, whose ideologies fall in line with hers, from liking her is the fact that 10 years ago she disagreed with what they believe now.  \n  \nI also believe a lot of the hate for her is generated as a \"meme\" or joke by the right and simply spread because it's fun and easy to just call her corrupt instead of actually criticizing her policies (and a media outlet gets more clicks from a \"Lying Shillary!\" headline than an article discussing the merits and downsides of her tax policy). All my educated conservative friends are voting Hillary this election and post articles on Facebook criticizing certain aspects of each candidates platform, and all my less educated moderate friends are voting Trump or 3rd party and post Shillary memes on Facebook, which I know is anecdotal but I'm sure some of you share a similar experience.  \n  \nAnyway, I don't think my view can be changed, but major kudos if you can show to me how Hillary is even remotely as misguided as Trump in terms of policy.",

            "selftext": "I'm absolutely disgusted by the state of this election. In elections past, at least I could respect both candidates even if I only liked one or neither. I can't remember an election where I couldn't at least respect either candidate.\n\nSo let's go one at a time.\n\nHillary:\n-proven to have broken the law intentionally and willfully\n-got away with criminal activities\n-manipulates the media to intentionally delude Americans\n-rigged the primary\n-pays people to start riots and fights at Trump rallies disguised as Bernie supporters\n-bullied potential rape victims into silence\n-abuses her not for profit charity foundation for political gains\nThat's only the things that are proven at this point. Who knows if she did or didn't have people killed. That's also not even addressing her issues with consistency over the years or any actual policy issues.\n\nTrump:\n-many (albeit unverified) allegations regarding sexual harassment and assault\n-history of blatant lying\n-complete lack of presidential professionalism to the point where that alone could cause massive international issues\n-though often misconstrued, he has made blatantly racist and misogynistic comments\n-completely changed stances on key issues within short time frames to opposite extremes\n\nHonestly I despise Trump, but he has less that's actually proven or criminal going against him.\n\nLong story short, how could you vote for either of these people? A vote for Hillary is saying \"I'm totally fine with this person being able to blatantly disregard the law, get away with it, and deliberately start violence to get her way.\" A vote for Trump is saying, \"I'm totally fine with my county being run by someone who could very easily ruin all of our international relations through being politically inept, as well as being represented by someone who frequently says hateful things.\"\n\nI think both candidates are bad people, and I think it's immoral to support either one of them. CMV.\n\nEDIT: since many people are asking for proof of my claims against Clinton (though I can't help but notice not a single person here has sought to defend Trump), I'm primarily citing the Wiki leaks emails, not just the podesta ones, but also the first batches that came out a while back. I am also citing the O'Keefe video. I know that historically he is far from a reputable source, however one can easily verify all the people in the video are who they say they are and work where they say they work. I am also referring to the FBI emails released today, which were released specifically because FBI agents feel the ruling on Clinton's investigation was not in line with the available evidence.\n\nhttps://wikileaks.org/podesta-emails/\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rh81tPvsjGg\n\nhttps://vault.fbi.gov/hillary-r.-clinton/hillary-r.-clinton-part-04-of-04/view\n\nDue to the sheer magnitude of emails, I can't obviously cite every single one of them. However, if you keyword search most major journalists, emails will come up showing Hillary dictating how she is represented in the publications, down to the choice of words. On top of that, if you look at the section of emails surrounding her hearing, there are several emails where comments are made about being lucky that \"they\" are focusing on the wrong emails, and even comments that heavily suggest she willfully withheld information relevant to the hearing.",

            "selftext": "It is understandable that people identify with one party or another and often vote along party lines. This only serves to perpetuate the problems and frustrations Americans have with the two-party system. Our election system essentially ensures a two-party system, but not all Democrats or Republicans are created equal. By listing the party affiliation of the candidates we ensure that the party, and not the candidate themselves, is the entity that is supported. At the Presidential level, this information is commonly known - for example, everyone knows Hillary Clinton is running as the Democratic candidate and Donald Trump is running as the Republican candidate. While party affiliation certainly comes into play when voting for President, people are exposed to the candidates as people simply due to the media saturation on their character, policies, and backgrounds which also can have significant impact on voters' decisions.\n\nAt the local level, there is FAR less media coverage on those issues. Typically, there are a few commercials that are either smear pieces or fluff pieces but voters have to dig and educate themselves to gain any real insight into those candidates character, policies, and background. So when they plop themselves down in the ballot box a significant portion of the population is just checking the boxes next to the D or the R.\n\nI'm not saying that people shouldn't be allowed to vote straight party if that is what they believe in, but we shouldn't make it easy **not** to educate themselves on the candidates before they pull the lever. It would be ridiculous to put \"Anti-gun control\" or \"Pro Choice\" next to candidates names, so why do we allow party affiliation. It says nothing as to whether they are a \"Good\" Democrat or a \"Good\" Republican, so that information can be just as misleading as any other descriptor you put next to a candidate's name.\n\nBy stripping the party affiliation from the ballots themselves, people will actually have to educate themselves on the candidates they are supporting. If you don't know who someone is or what they stand for, you really have no business supporting them. If you want to vote along party lines, that information is not difficult to find before hand there's no good reason to spoonfeed that information as you're making your selections - in fact, that practice can be more deceiving than not.\n\n_____\n\n> *Hello, users of CMV!

We agree that people shouldn\u2019t be fired for their political views, but this isn\u2019t a disagreement on tax policy, this is advocating hatred and violence,\u201d Pao wrote. [article](https://techcrunch.com/2016/10/17/trump-silicon-valley-surrogate-thiel/)\n\n(Background: Thiel is a controversial Silicon Valley figure, known for funding the anti-Gawker lawsuit after Gawker outed him as gay, and for supporting Trump when 99% of the Valley opposes him. There is currently a movement to get Thiel banned from various positions because of his support for Trump.)\n\nMy argument:\n\n * Yes, hatred and violence are dangerous and despicable things. People can get hurt by them - actually, seriously hurt.\n * But \"this isn't a disagreement on tax policy\" suggests tax policy is some boring thing that *can't* seriously hurt people. That's not true. Tax policy isn't some boring thing for accountants. Taxes can send people into poverty. They can make the difference between being able to pay their rent or being homeless. Or being able to financially survive an illness. People's lives can get ruined from this stuff. A tax system that favors the rich and harms everyone else can have results indistinguishable from violence and hatred.\n * \"Oh that's just tax policy\" is something only a financially well-off person would say. To such a person, raising taxes might be annoying but nothing more. Such a person dismissing taxes as immaterial is showing a lack of empathy for vulnerable people.\n * I get that the people saying such quotes are looking for a \"boring\" part of politics in order to say, \"there is that boring stuff, and then *there is this issue I care about*\". **But it's all in the second category.** Everything political is controversial and significant, because if it wasn't, politicians wouldn't fight about it. Politicians fight about abortion and war and civil rights and taxes because in each of those issues at least one side feels very strongly about it, often both, and there are big things at stake - life, quality of life, values.\n\n_____\n\n> *Hello, users of CMV!

            "selftext": "This is a thought that comes from all the recent media focus during the US election, but applies more generally, to all countries of the world, to all leaders (whether they are presidents, prime ministers, queens, whatever).  For the sake of simplicity, I will stick to the USA because it's the hot topic at the moment..\n\nWhen deciding who to vote for, the question each American should ask themselves is \"who is going to be most likely to run the country well?\".  \n\nAll these sexual allegations against Trump, and leaked documents implicating Clinton ... they should certainly be followed up on, legally.  And if fault can be proven, they should be prosecuted.\n\nHowever, for the average voter, I don't think it should matter if Trump is a total sleazebag or Clinton is the world's biggest liar.  If a complete sleazebag has better economic/social policies and a better grasp on how to improve the country and its international relations than his opponent, Americans should want to vote for the sleazebag even if the opponent is a saint in their personal life.\n\nThe best headmaster isn't the one who never gets speeding fines.  The best employer isn't the one who has never been arrested for drug use.  The best president isn't the one who has never been sexually inappropriate.\n\n---\nThe main crux of my view that I would like to discuss is this:  Americans ***should*** want to be electing the candidate who is best suited to be making decisions for the country.  Their personal faults and indiscretions are a poor indicator of this.\n\nFurthermore, those who would have their vote depend upon these factors are doing so with superficiality, and are not acting in the country's (or even their own) best interests.\n\n**Edit**: a couple of comments, so far, have made be feel the need to emphasize the following:\nIf Trump is shown to have committed sexual assault, I agree that he is unfit to be president.  And votes should reflect this.  \nHowever, to the best of my knowledge, this is not the case and the benefit of the doubt needs to be given.  Everything out there, so far, are words he's spoken (insensitive, but still just words) and unproven allegations.\nSo, my CMV is referring to the things we know that he has done (e.g. the \"grab them by the pussy\" comment).\n\nEdit 2: Thank you for the comments.  Deltas awarded.  I'm not going to respond to any more comments, because they're almost exclusively \"Trump must be guilty, because several people are alleging it\" and \"a bad person cannot be president, because they're a bad person\".\n_____\n\n> *Hello, users of CMV!

Clinton is broadcasted to be leading in the polls, and a study in recent months has shown that even Trump supporters have been noted to think their candidate is less likely to win the bid for presidency than Clinton, especially Trump supporters who are college educated or in higher income brackets. Clinton is currently the clear favorite in the election, but many Trump voters seem to believe that he's gaining momentum, when in acuality he is losing it.\n\nSo here's the view to change; there is nothing out there that indicates that Donald Trump is going to win over Hillary. This isn't to say he will definitely lose, but at this point in time there's no logical reason to assume he's \"winning\".\n\n_____\n\n> *Hello, users of CMV! This is a footnote from your moderators.

With Trump, who *knows* what could happen within a year - we could make it to Mars, or we could end up balls deep in Russia for the start of world war 3. At least there's excitement in that - change, progress, whatever. Hillary is the opposite of all that, nothing would change, and while there are many who don't want things to change, that is not the point of government. At least not until we have a perfect government and everyone knows we are far from that. If anything, can the last two decades of Clinton history show that as a senator she opposed a lot of things we today would consider progress in society?\n\n_____\n\n> *Hello, users of CMV!

            "selftext": "Now strongly support does not mean vote for.  It does not mean they think they have two bad options and will vote for Trump. Strongly support means you are excited that he was nominated and think he will be a good-great President. \n\nHe has no issue on which he is strong on:\n\nAbortion.  \n\nProbably the best reason for a pro life person to vote for Trump.  However, if you are pro life, you can at best view Trump as tolerable.  Most of his life he has stated that he is pro choice and has described the Republican party as being crazy far right.  And honestly, I'm extremely skeptical that  a Trump presidency would decrease abortions more than a Hillary president would.  Birth control is the most effective means of reducing abortions.  Under Clinton, birth control would be much more widely available than under Trump.  Furthermore, even a lot of pro life judges will respect precedent and refuse to overturn Roe v Wade.  \n\nFurthermore, given that he has vowed to start killing the babies and wives and siblings of terrorists, I don't think he's the right choice for someone who values human life.\n\nEconomic policy\n\nThis is outside my area of expertise so I concede that if you have an advanced degree in economics and you truly believe his policies will be beneficial to the country as a whole and not just yourself I would be open to changing my view.  However, his tax policy, on its surface, seems absurd.  It looks like it will wildly add to the debt.  Now, debt isn't inherently bad, but you need to be investing the resources properly to justify taking on that debt.  This tax cut won't be one that pays for itself according to virtually every think tank.\n\nHe criticizes Obama for TARP and the stimulus yet the overwhelming consensus is that these actions saved us from economic disaster.  \n\nMaybe he is dumbing it down for the viewers,but the way he talks about economic policy seems so uninformed and childish.  He says the debt increased under Obama and GDP growth has been slow and therefore Obama's policies were bad.  That kind of correlation based argument just makes him look wildly uninformed about economic policy.\n\nImmigration\n\nNet immigration has been essentially zero for years.  Rapists aren't pouring over the boarder.  At least before he said he was going to deport the people who are here illegally but he has since back tracked on that.  So he's going to waste tens of billions of dollars on the boarder wall and patrol in order to fight a non-existent problem.\n\nForeign Policy\n\nAgain, he's either a liar or wildly uninformed.  He thinks he knows better than all the generals and intelligence officers which is scary.  He was told that Putin was behind the hack and just chooses not to believe it.  Not listening to people a lot smarter and a lot more knowledgeable than him is perhaps his most dangerous attribute. Which brings me to:\n\nTemperament and overall fitness to be President\n\nHe is either stupid or a compulsive liar.  He claims he knows more than all the generals.  He claims he knows more than all the climate scientists.  He claims there does not exist a single person in the world who respects women more.  He claims if he loses Pennsylvania it will be because it was rigged despite every poll showing him down.  He claims the election is rigged against him even though it hasn't happened yet and he is 7 points down in the polls.  He brags about language that either pushes the boundary of what is consent or is actually sexual assault.  He can't control himself when other people are talking.  He shouts in the middle of Hillary's answers that she is wrong about things there is actual video of him saying.  \n\nHere is a brief list of things he has lied about:\n\nHis position on the Iraq war\n\nHis position on invading Libya\n\nMocking a disabled New York Times reporter\n\nObama  founded ISIS \n\nObama supported al Qaeda\n\nHaving very credible evidence Obama was born in Kenya\n\nUnemployment is 40%\n\nJapan and others should have nukes\n\nThe state dept lost 6 billion dollars\n\nI never told people to check out Ms. Universe's sex tape\n\nDavid Petraeus did far less than Hillary  regarding the emails\n\nThere is large scale voter fraud and the election is rigged\n\nCrime is way up and the cities have never been more dangerous\n\nHe makes Hillary look like honest Abe.  His lies are Bosnian sniper fire level of just objectively false and insane.\n_____\n\n> *Hello, users of CMV! This is a footnote from your moderators.

We would then have a sitting president who doesn\u2019t trust democracy in its current form?\nThis could result in two dark consequences:\n1) During his re-election campaign Trump would likely continue his claims that the election and media are \u201crigged\u201d and as president, could go about trying to \u201cfix\u201d them.  In office, Trump could make changes to the electoral system to make the less rigged in his mind, or more specifically, more friendly to him.  As well, he has contempt for any media that doesn\u2019t absolutely kiss his ass (so every media org except Breitbart right now, since most of Fox cant even stand him at this point) and he starts changing the libel laws and restricting free press as he\u2019s talked of doing a number of times.\n2) Secondly, What would an incumbent Trump president do on Election night 2020?  If he lost, would he gracefully step aside? Or would he use any method at his disposal to, again, dispute the outcome of the election.  Doubting elections and calling them rigged is a lot scary of a statement coming from the head of state himself.\nI\u2019d love some thoughts on this from the other side. Thanks\n",

Mainly that voting third party is a mistake and that they are voting for the lesser of two evils. It is rough to know that, regardless if you are a Democrat or republican that if your candidate does not win, the president will probably be you LEAST favorite choice and is someone you had zero say in.\n\nThis is why I think American Idol style would help. We take the top 10 candidates. Clinton, Trump, Cruz, Burnie, Stein etc. And we vote. The one who gets the least votes is eliminated and then we vote again on the nine remaining. This removes the idea that voting third party is a waste, because if they get eliminated you then get to vote for someone else. It gives 3rd party a chance. It creates a situation that if your favorite candidate does not win your second or third favorite may win. It is over all just better.\n\nNote: I know there is an issue in that we would have to go out and vote nine separate times. For the sake of discussion, let's just say that there is a way to make that work. In other words mentioning that will not lead to deltas.",

            "selftext": "Numerically, more people voted for Bernie Sanders than voted for Donald Trump. However, the negative campaigning brought out more people to vote, leaves a close margin between Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton and high unfavorables for both (sexual assault, WWIII, nuclear war, climate catastrophe, wikileaks, Russian afternoon delight) despite Hillary Clinton winning over most of the Democrats. Hillary Clinton could step down/be asked to step down for reasons from health to potential investigations. In which case a new candidate would be selected (such as Joe Biden, Tim Kaine, or Bernie Sanders, I can't think of anyone else who could possibly be considered vetted). More people voted for Bernie Sanders than Donald Trump in the primary, which doesn't include independents who were taken off voting rolls, couldn't vote, in a state with a closed primary, etc. The Democratic Party should start this process, or everyone should vote for Jill Stein based on her policies, knowing that as a doctor she would have a sensible position on herd immunity and vaccines, and that Congress wouldn't allow anything crazy to happen (unless we had an authoritarian president), especially considering that she'll have to compromise with both parties, who will want to look like they are getting things done.\n\nNote, I'm not looking at how this can happen (as that would require massive funding to break through the media blackout), I'm simply observing that this would be a way to avert rising tensions with Russia, avoid WWIII, stop the world from burning up, keep diplomatic ties with our allies strong, or at least give us an attempt of doing so while gaining a sensible policy in the Middle East.\n\nJill Stein interview: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KCc4CXxxf0g\nWho would replace Hillary Clinton if she had to step down? http://heavy.com/news/2016/09/who-would-bernie-replace-hillary-clinton-if-dropped-out-democratic-nominee-health-kaine-biden-videos-pneumonia/\nI get my data from real politics and the voting totals.\n\n[Edit] So, clearly it's after the votes have begun. And while it's closer than it could be, Clinton is likely to win. It'd be more certain otherwise, and probably Trump supporters would come on board who see a sensible solution that isn't Hillary Clinton. It'd take a crazy change like an election holiday and real electoral reforms for that to happen. So of course, this isn't really going to happen without marches or strikes or something. It's a shame we don't have strong unions anymore.\n\n_____\n\n> *Hello, users of CMV! This is a footnote from your moderators. We'd just like to remind you of a couple of things.

            "selftext": "Both Trump and Hillary have talked about instating a no-fly zone in Syria, something that Russia would certainly not obey and could lead to an escalation in tension/act of war, if a plane was shot down by the US.\n\nThere has also been much more talk lately on the use of nuclear weapons, Russia has backed out of an agreement with the US stating that it would not strike first. They have also just recently practiced moving 40 million people into bomb shelters.\n\nRussia also hates Hillary Clinton, the candidate who I see as more likely to win the election. Multiple Russian officials have stated that electing Hillary would result in an immediate war with Russia. Even if this war did not occur immediately, tensions would certainly continue to rise and the risk of nuclear weapons use would increase imo.\n\nBasically, tensions seem to be at an all time high, and the direction the US and Russia are heading seem to want to make matters worse, I understand no country wants to use a nuke but the possibility seems to be growing exponentially with time, please change my view.\n\n_____\n\n> *Hello, users of CMV!

            "selftext": "I stopped following the news because I believe I am being mislead by the media. I'll try to explain my point of view with a few examples.\n\nReports on terrorist attacks rarely fail to mention religion. Repeated reading of such reports can make one believe that religion is somehow responsible, that terrorist attacks are motivated by religion. My view on this is that religion is just a method which is used to persuade a person to execute a terrorist attack.\n\nReligion itself does not have any motives, humans have motives and we use different methods to achieve our goals. A better point of view can be gained by examining what those motives are. Any organisation that is capable of executing large scale attacks must be lead by very capable and intelligent people. Mass media can make us believe that those people are irrational. Surely Osama bin Laden was smart enough to know that the 9/11 attack was not going to result in anything good for him, his people and his religion? So why did he do it? We can't know for sure but it surely wasn't anger or spite since any person that is capable of leading a large organisation does not let his emotions influence his decisions, he must have had a rational reasoning.\n\n\nAnything goes once we accept the irrational point of view. You can kill in the name of God who said thou shalt not kill, you can even kill in the name of human rights, dismissing the right to life. \n\n\nMass media also tried to convince us that George W. Bush was irrational and even stupid. There were countless reports on him saying dumb shit, pictures of him holding a book upside down, holding the phone upside down etc.. Does anyone really believe he is stupid? Does anyone believe one of the current US presidential candidates really is as dumb as they want to appear to be?\n\n\nSince i touched the US elections I want to point out another issue. I often see arguments like Trump is against immigration but USA was made by immigrants and he is married to an immigrant. He must be irrational, right? Well i don't think so, his immigration policy is not about history or his marriage it is about how immigration affects the people in US today. Anyone making those kind of arguments is being purposefully ignorant and mass media forcing the irrational point of view plays a big part in it.\n\n\nCVM please so i can follow the news again.\n\nEdit: my view has been changed. It is not medias responsibility to analyze events, it is up to the consumer to think about reported events. Special thanks to everyone that focused on the title despite my controversial examples.\n\nSee you in /r/worldnews :)\n_____\n\n> *Hello, users of CMV! This is a footnote from your moderators.

            "selftext": "Right now, the Republican nominee for President of the United States and many of his supporters are publicly and incessantly claiming that the Presidential election process is rigged. They claim as evidence what they believe to be systematic media bias against them as well as the potential for voter fraud. In this subreddit, in fact, I've spoken with Redditors who feel the same way, and believe that if their candidate loses the election, this will be evidence that it has been rigged. \n\nI believe that this rhetoric, and especially Donald Trump's refusal to commit to accepting the election's outcome (unless he's the winner), is extremely dangerous. I believe that not only is it untrue, but continuing to pursue it not only undermines (perhaps purposefully) the integrity of our democratic process and damages said candidate's campaign, but also decreases the safety of the average American and promotes an atmosphere of hate and potentially violence. I'll examine each of these beliefs in part, with evidence.\n\nFirst, **the election is not rigged.** That is, the election is not being run in a fraudulent manner and the results of the Electoral College will accurately represent the will of the American people (at least, to the same degree of accuracy as they do in every election cycle). Further, whether the media is biased or not does not affect whether the election is rigged because while the media might be able to persuade someone to change their vote, doing so is well within the boundaries of our laws and in no way compromises the integrity of the electoral process. \n\nI'll clear up the latter issue first, because I think it's essentially a non-starter: Unless you are actually committing or encouraging someone to commit voter fraud, you're not \"rigging\" anything. Talking to people - on the radio, online, on TV, anywhere - is neither criminal, illegal, or punishable, nor should it be. As I mentioned in [another post on this subject](https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/58xvi4/cmv_the_election_truly_is_rigged_because_of_the/d94dved/?context=3), to put it bluntly, if elections could be rigged by people persuading other people to vote one way or another, we'd all be in jail. That's all the media is doing - regardless of which direction they're doing it in, whether they're aware of that direction, whether it's on purpose, and so on. While I don't see any evidence that the media has a systematic bias (individual outlets often do, but it is never consistent or significant enough across them to be considered as the American press as a whole), even if they did, them telling people what they think people should do is part of having a free press, and is not fraud.\n\nThus, **the only way the election could be \"rigged\" by the traditional definition of the term is through some sort of systematic fraud**. (I use the traditional definition because those wishing to advance an alternative one need to make a compelling argument for it, and I haven't seen one.) Such a fraud would be impressively difficult, requiring a conspiracy of unprecedented and, frankly, impossible scale in today's era of leaks and scandals. Every state has an *independent* system of election laws and authorities who enforce those elections. Not only that, but the majority of state election authorities are run by Republicans, who have no incentive to rig anything in favor of the other party. To use the system to commit fraud would require an infiltration and compromising of the mechanics of, at the very least, the ten-ish states [usually considered swing states](http://www.politico.com/blogs/swing-states-2016-election/2016/06/what-are-the-swing-states-in-2016-list-224327). We're talking billions of dollars and hundreds, if not thousands, of conspirators to make that happen. It would collapse under its own weight.\n\nBut all that's moot, because **[voter fraud in the United States is shockingly rare](https://ballotpedia.org/Voter_fraud)** ([another source](http://fivethirtyeight.com/features/voter-fraud-is-very-rare-in-american-elections/), there are many, many more) and when it does happen, it happens on a scale that is simply too small to shift an election. Plus, voter fraud rarely survives efforts to suss it out - and those efforts are frequently conducted, especially in states with things like voter ID laws. So if there *was* fraud, we'd find it, but there isn't. Claims to the contrary are without persuasive evidence; even articles [claiming voter fraud is a problem](http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2016/oct/17/no-voter-fraud-isnt-myth-10-cases-where-its-all-to/) are scant on real evidence and details. (By the way, that article is from the \"mainstream media,\" while the two sources I linked to support my point are not.)  \n\nHaving demonstrated thus that the election cannot be reasonably said to be rigged, I'll move to **why I believe that claiming it *is* rigged is so dangerous.** First and foremost is a reason that is no surprise to anyone, since it matches the commentary of pundits on both sides about this issue: We have, as Donald Trump likes to say, a \"nation of laws.\" When we call those laws into question, we also undermine their effectiveness. Sometimes, it's right and good to do so - a bad law should be changed. But the system of elections is a law that is not broken and does not need to be changed. If people lose faith in the process - or spend time questioning processes that don't need to be changed instead of working on the things should be fixed - you're taking time, energy, and money from the real problems facing out country. \n\nAnd why is it necessary? **Arguing that the election is rigged is the Republican campaign's equivalent of drawing and firing a gun into the street for no reason**: Not only doesn't it make sense, but anything you hit that gets hurt is your responsibility. Arguing that the election is rigged may galvanize Trump's base, but it will not convince anyone who didn't already trust him, and especially not anyone who goes looking for real evidence. Arguing that the nation is that fundamentally broken is divisive and hurtful at a time when, in order to win, the candidate ought to be trying to unite the nation behind him (that is, after all, what he claims to want to do, and it's certainly what his opponent is trying to do). It's not good for his campaign, and it represents a disconnect from reality that I believe the majority of the American public disapproves of (polls certainly bear me out in this instance). \n\nFinally, **there is a real risk of violence and serious endangerment of civil liberties as a result of this rhetoric.**[White extremists kill more people in this country than Islamic terrorists](http://time.com/3934980/right-wing-extremists-white-terrorism-islamist-jihadi-dangerous/). Most of them support Trump, and many of them have not been disavowed or even acknowledged as illegitimate by the campaign. [Trump supporters are already calling for violent revolution](https://www.bostonglobe.com/news/politics/2016/10/15/donald-trump-warnings-conspiracy-rig-election-are-stoking-anger-among-his-followers/LcCY6e0QOcfH8VdeK9UdsM/story.html) and [Trump has a history of inciting violent rhetoric](http://www.politico.com/story/2016/08/trump-violent-rhetoric-history-226873). What's worse, though, is that if Trump loses, if, as he has suggested, he does not concede, and if, as they have suggested, his supporters *do* go out and commit violent acts on November 9th in response, what follows will almost certainly be a government crackdown and further degradation of our civil liberties, just as we've seen in the wake of other protests and riots over recent years. That's bad for everyone.\n\nI believe that whether you want to build a wall, fund universal healthcare, or both or neither, this rhetoric is dangerous, harmful nonsense, and it ought to be the place where Americans draw a line in the sand and say \"stop.\" I don't believe that anyone who believes in the power and integrity of our democracy can reasonably vote for a candidate who so obviously and coarsely rejects it without any basis in fact.

            "selftext": "As Hillary has become more likely to win the election and the Democrats have started to open up a large enough lead in downballot races to make taking the House a realistic possibility, [Hillary's campaign has started to redirect resources to downballot races.](http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/nationworld/politics/ct-indiana-missouri-democrats-clinton-coattails-20161022-story.html) However, it is late enough in the election that it is possible that this will not have the effect that redirecting these resources earlier would have had. Obviously, Hillary needed to secure a lead in the presidential race before focusing on downballot elections,  but there is 1 state that she has spent a lot of time and money on that stands out as a state that she could have ignored in favor of helping downballot candidates or spending money in other swing states that are a better fit for her campaign. That state is Ohio, for 2 reasons (if you just want to hear the short version, skip to the end).\n\n1. Ohio is the second-most Trump-leaning swing state after Iowa. Despite his struggles with the state GOP, [he will almost certainly do much better there than he does nationally](http://www.centerforpolitics.org/crystalball/articles/why-trump-will-do-better-in-ohio-than-he-does-nationally/). Even with a normal candidate, Ohio is usually one of the more Republican-leaning swing states, and Trump's message is tailor-made for it. [The state Democratic Party is in shambles.](http://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2015/11/weary-from-losses-ohio-democrats-try-to-rebuild/457977/) [Ohio ranks as the state that has the 13th lowest percentage of residents with a college education in the country.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_U.S._states_by_educational_attainment) [81.1% of the state is non-Hispanic white.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ohio#Demographics). The Republicans had their convention there. It is just a terrible fit for Hillary's campaign, Hillary could easily win without it, and the resources that her campaign is spending on it would have been far better spent on states that are more critical to her ability to win the election.\n\n2. Usually, when a campaign is spending money on a state that it doesn't need to win, it is to help downballot candidates. That is not the case with Ohio. [Ohio has no competitive House elections this year.](http://cookpolitical.com/house/charts/race-ratings) [Neither chamber of the Ohio State Legislature has a chance of flipping this year.](https://ballotpedia.org/State_legislative_battleground_chambers,_2016) [Other than the Senate race in Ohio, there are no statewide elections in Ohio this year.](https://ballotpedia.org/Ohio_elections,_2016), and [that Senate race has been leaning heavily Republican since mid-August](http://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/2016-election-forecast/senate/ohio/). So basically, even if Clinton wins Ohio, it will mean nothing. In contrast, if she spent that money in Indiana, Missouri, North Carolina, Florida, New Hampshire, Nevada, Pennsylvania, Wisconsin, Colorado, Michigan, Virginia, Iowa, Arizona, Montana, Minnesota, New York, California, New Jersey, Maine, New Mexico, Alaska, Utah, Illinois, Washington, Kentucky, West Virginia, Vermont, Nebraska, Texas, or Kansas, she'd be helping out downballot candidates more, because there is at least one close gubernatorial, House, or Senate race in all of those states or a close race to control a state legislative chamber. By spending money on Ohio instead of in areas where downballot candidates need help, Hillary's campaign is weakening the Democratic Party's efforts to succeed in downballot elections.\n\nBasically, Ohio contributes nothing to Hillary's campaign. If she wins it, it probably would mean that she had already gotten 270 electoral votes from other states, and if she loses it, it is still relatively easy for her to win. Even if she does win Ohio, it won't help any downballot candidates win their elections. Winning Ohio would just be a meaningless cherry on top of a Hillary victory, and the resources that it takes to win Ohio would thus be better spent on states that Hillary needs to win or where downballot candidates need support.\n\n_____\n\n> *Hello, users of CMV!

            "selftext": "I understand voting against trump. If you supported Bernie and you believe Hillary to actually be corrupt, you are a hypocrite if you don't vote for every republican you can who can contain her power and prevent her from overreaching. Giving her carte blanche in the oval office after all the outcry over her corruption, how she is in the pocket of corporations etc. If she is as corrupt as the left was saying during the primary, I believe you have an ethical responsibility to back those words up and limit the power she has in office. I understand this changes with local government and a senators power to change things locally, I am speaking purely on an ideological level.\n\nEdit: to further clarify because I don't think I fully knew what I was proposing when i first posted this: my underlying point is that I have no confidence in the democrats to police their own. no one will call her on anything that she is doing that is underhanded, i see a track record of a lack of accountability within her party that gives me confidence that if the dems controlled everything, they would let her do whatever she wanted, not on policies, but in terms of selling our government to the highest foreign bidder as she did when she was secretary of state and even after in preparation for taking the white house (as an example).\n\nI don't feel much more confidence in the GOP policing their own incidentally, I'm not holding the democrats to an unfair standard. though i will say the backlash the right has had against trump does give me more confidence in them to call out bullshit from their own party. Not hearing the same backlash against hillary, in spite of the avalanche of scandal on her that is uncovered every day. I get that people will still want to vote for her, but when everyone in her party is working so hard to cover up or flat out lie to the public, it's concerning. Why not hold both candidates feet to the fire for bad things they have done? Is power so important that principle has to be sacrificed? I think the support for Trump on the right or lack thereof should tell you how the GOP feels about it.\n\nEdit 2: Please, let's cut the bullshit, if the emails were lies, they would have denied them rather than every single dem making a stupid pivot to how it isn't their corruption that mattered, only that russia was trying to influence the election by showing how corrupt they are, as if that is russia's fault. so let's just skip that argument, it won't change my view. Hillary hasn't denied it, so it's fact.\n\nOkay, so now i feel like even I understand my position better. Change my view\n\nedit 3: this is just kinda turning into a political debate about how good a pres obama has been, which is a debate im willing to have, but it's not really fair to people who think he has been. so...play at your own risk i guess.\n\n_____\n\n> *Hello, users of CMV!

Studying them has been a personal hobby of mine, and I took a class about them from a top level university, and met my professor every week to discuss with them more on the subject. I know the general blueprint of a gun type bomb, the potential destabilizing effects of MIRVs, nuclear ambiguous posturing, boomers, KT and MT yields, why you can't make a nuclear bomb from just yellow cake uranium, deterrence, MAD, Waltz and Sagan, ect. Point is, I'm pretty well read in the field. \n\nHowever, for all I know about them, I'm ridiculously under qualified to be commander and chief on that point (assuming I was competent in everything else). Hell, I'm not even knowledgable about them to get a good job at certain think tanks. And I admit this freely. \n\nWhich is why when Trump demonstrates his rambling answers on nukes, the fact that he does not seem to grasp what the triad is, that Russia is 'expanding', that our forces \"have fallen behind\" (bull, we have roughly the number of nukes as the Russians, not to mention far superior and numerical aircraft and boomers) or rambling on about first use (he kept trying to say that he would be unpredictable, but at the same time not use them first, which is a very bad policy. He was unaware of our current policy is ambiguous on first use, not because of deterrence for ourselves per se [You can still deter a nuclear attack with a no first use policy], but for our allies. If say, the Chinese were preparing to attack taiwan [treaty ally] and we were not confident in our ability to beat them back conventionally [thanks to their 'carrier killer' missiles] we leave it open to use tactical nuclear weapons as a last resort to defend our allies, which helps cement our security guarantee and deter attacks on our allies. That is why I was so impressed with Clinton in the first debate when that came up, as she immediately said America will defend its allies [but didn't explicitly say we will use nukes, because that is bellicose and saber rattling]) is so scary to me as a voter. \n\n\nNot to mention his comments (and muddling around with) on Japan and SK with nukes is horrifying (if either thought that the nuclear umbrella was not absolute, they might try to create their own weapons, and say goodbye to the NPT) \n\n\nI'm not interested in talking about the ethics of nuclear weapons in general (I'll save that for another time), I merely think that it is crazy that I know a damn sight more about the most destructive things in human history than the man who just might control them, and I'm not even that learned about them. When the nukes are the cornerstone of our military, not knowing about them in significant detail (I.E. more than a 20 something Uni grad who didn't even major in them)\n\nI'm not attacking trump on anything else but this issue for this question.\n\nI'm also not interested in discussing Clinton. I'm confident she know enough about nukes.\n\nTL;DR- I know more than the average joe on nukes, but not enough to be trusted with them as all. I know more than Trump, and he might get control of them.....WTF?\n_____\n\n> *Hello, users of CMV! This is a footnote from your moderators. We'd just like to remind you of a couple of things.

Secondly, I have very little regard for James Comey's integrity as a public figure (I think his past statements have shown him to be a racist and a partisan Republican feigning impartiality), so my view also does not stem from any great trust in his word.\n\n\nBut I think, despite the intense criticism he has received from Democrats, that he objectively did the right thing sending the letter to Congress, and he does not deserve to be blamed for this action.\n\n\nConsider:\n\n* While leaks seem to suggest that the e-mails have not even been read yet, and are likely duplicates of e-mails that have already been examined, the fact remains that they are technically speaking new evidence in the case, and the FBI would be negligent not to examine them.\n\n* Comey had been basically forced during his testimony to Congress to pledge that he would update Congress if any new evidence came to light.  For him not to notify Congress that this evidence existed would have been a breach of this pledge.\n\n* On the matter of timing: consider that if he waited until after November 9 in order not to cause undue influence on the election, and then it became known that he had kept this information from the public, it would have become much worse for Clinton (as it would then have lent credence to the Trump claims of a \"conspiracy\" to elect Clinton, and seriously undermined her ability to govern).\n\n* On the issue of how vague his statement was: he really didn't have any alternative, since it seems like the FBI really doesn't have any idea yet of what was in the emails and may not even yet have a warrant to read them.  It wasn't Comey's original letter that was responsible for creating the distorted impression that the media reported as a \"bombshell\" on Friday-- it was the media itself (and by extension, the members of Congress who leaked the story to them) who chose to report its contents dishonestly.\n\n\nUltimately, I think we should be holding the media more accountable for the way that this story has blown up out of proportion to the known facts, and recognize that Comey was just doing his job.\n_____\n\n> *Hello, users of CMV!

            "selftext": "First of all, I will say that I am not a Trump supporter. I am an independent with some liberal and some conservative leanings. I am very torn about who to vote for in this election and I see both candidates as equally terrible in their own ways. I might even vote for a third party candidate. \n\nBut let's tackle the obvious of why Trump is terrible. He is openly racist, sexist, and Islamophobic. He has won appeal through fear mongering. He has bankrupted somewhere between 4-6 of his own companies. And he has NO political experience. \n\nWith that said, here is why I think Hillary is terrible. While Trump has no experience, her experience has been bad experience. With regards to the whole email situation, I actually don't care about that too much. What I care about is that she is a warmonger. She supported the war in Iraq in 2003. She supported intervening in Syria, Yemen, and Libya -- and now these places are disasters. \n\nSo while Trump has bankrupted at least 4 companies, she has helped in the destruction of at least four whole countries. \n\nShe wants to put a no fly zone in Syria, even though the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff General Joseph Francis Dunford has warned both the US Senate as well Secretary of State John Kerry in no uncertain terms that a \u201cNo Fly Zone\u201d over Syria would lead to war with both Syria and Russia. And many of the Democrats I've talked to have defended this by saying, \"Well Russia doesn't want a war with the U.S, she would discuss this with Russia before hand.\" But here is the thing about wars. In most situations, no one wants a war. In 1914, none of the countries in Europe wanted war. Wars happen as a result of a string of events that build up hostility and tension until the point that war is unavoidable, and we're getting to the point where this will be the case with Russia. America cannot afford a war with Russia. In the worst case scenario, if things go nuclear, they have more nukes than we do. But even if tensions don't go nuclear, this still has the capability to be an immense economic strain on the U.S's already limited resources. \n\nHillary's support for arming rebels in conflicts has also indirectly resulted in the creation of ISIS and other terrorist organizations. \n\nNow Trump has said that he wants to stop America's failed policy of nation building, while Hillary seems interested in continuing with this course. Trump is also interested in a peaceful relationship with Russia. And I don't really care about the possibility that Russian hackers tried to interfere with U.S. elections, because the reality is that most countries (including the United States) are spying on one another electronically. That and the U.S. interfered with elections in Ukraine against Russia's interest. So they really aren't doing anything that we don't already do. What is also dangerous though is that Hillary has said that she would possibly use military action against those who commit cyber warfare against the United States [Source: The Hill](http://thehill.com/policy/cybersecurity/293970-clinton-treat-cyberattacks-like-any-other-attack).\n\nNow when it comes to the things that Trump has claimed he will do that scare people, I doubt he's actually going to do a lot of these things. I highly doubt that he will deport 11 million illegal immigrants from the United States. This would be devastating for some of his own businesses. I doubt he would have the political power to do this. And it would be a task that would be very difficult to implement. I do think he would build a wall, but I don't think a wall is as big of a deal as people make it out to be. And the fact that he'd limit immigration of people from countries involving current conflicts (like Syria) doesn't really impact me on a personal day to day basis, aside from keeping me safer from a possible terrorist leaking into the Trojan horse of refugees entering this country. This has happened in Europe already where some of the refugees have identified people among them who were involved in ISIS. \n\nI believe that what America needs is a focus on infrastructure, jobs and friendly relations with Russia in order to help stabilize the Middle East. I feel like Trump would at least be helpful in these respects. \n\nSo in this election, I see it as a choice between a military imperialist and a nationalist. Neither are great. But military imperialism is what ends up destroying most major empires in history. Rome spread itself too thin in doing this as well as Democratic Athens. While a less militant, more nationalistic America would focus on other world powers as partners in trade, rather than potential military adversaries.\n \nMy worst fear with Trump is that in his stupidity and incompetence he would blow up the economy. \n\nBut my worst fear with Hillary Clinton is that she would drag us into a war with a nuclear super power.\n\nIn this regard, I feel like Trump is actually the lesser evil. But I am definitely open-minded to being proven wrong, because while seeing him as a lesser evil, I am definitely no fan of him at all. \n\nEDIT: Need to leave the house for something, but I'll look at more of these when I get back. Keep posting! Lots of great, well thought out points here. I'll read more when I get back and decide if I'm going to award a delta or not. \n\nEDIT 2: I need to think for a while if my view is changed or not. I'll at least know by election day! But I'm definitely getting swayed by these arguments.  \n\nFINAL EDIT: So I'd like to say you all have successfully changed my view and I will award you all a \u2206...Can I do that? Hillary's aggressive policies still scare me, but you all have done a good job of pointing out to me that Trump has the capability to be just as aggressive/destructive, except with him it could be worse because he has a tendency to lash out and punish people over minor slights, and no one has any ability to control him (not even his campaign staff). So he'd be an unguided missile -- literally and figuratively.\n_____\n\n> *Hello, users of CMV! This is a footnote from your moderators. We'd just like to remind you of a couple of things.

            "selftext": "I cannot understand how this man has so much support.\n\nIt seems quite clear that he lies about everything and gaslights routinely. He bullies anyone who criticizes him and seems to have difficulty putting a simple sentence together. He lacks the maturity and poise I'd expect from a Presidential candidate. I find his views horrifying, and his rise is very reminiscent of old fascist regimes and demagogues that you can read about in the history books.\n\nI asked a question in [CMV a while back about Hillary](https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/57cvqm/cmv_convince_me_that_hillary_is_terrible_maybe/) and now understand why people might dislike her, but even if we take her at her worst, I don't understand how Trump is even close -- he seems so much worse to me.\n\n\"Hillary put national security at risk!\" is a common retort. Let's assume this is true. Do you really think Trump cares about laws and rules? His narcissism overrides his reason and I can't imagine that he would somehow stay within the confines of the law more than Hillary. In fact, the opposite seems a lot more likely. To go even further, he quite openly shows disdain for the law and only appears to care about laws that hurt minorities (his whole \"law and order\" speech which felt like dogwhistling to me).\n\nOr \"he tells it like it is!\" is another one I don't understand, considering that he changes his views any time he's backed into a corner, and lies all the time. I literally have no idea what he'd actually do in office.\n\nOr \"we can't afford to be politically correct anymore!\" I understand that political correctness can be overly stifling and a frustrating topic to navigate, and agree that maybe we've gone too far in the wrong direction, but it seems like his definition of \"not being politically correct\" is just acting like a bullying jackass who shouldn't be held responsible for his words, even if he uses foul language to denigrate someone. I think people conflate being an asshole with not being politically correct.\n\nAnd yet despite his comments about starting wars, screwing people over, treating women like objects, fomenting distrust in anyone who isn't white, he has an incredible support base.\n\nDo supporters just not care? Is it mostly due to hostility towards women and minorities? Do they want to see the nation crumble? Do they want to have a President who bullies everyone and tries to uphold power by brute force? Do they not care about human rights? Are they primarily disenfranchised individuals who want others to hurt as they hurt? I can't pick apart all the dog whistling and coded speak and cognitive dissonance and contradictions. None of it makes sense to me.\n\nCan someone explain the appeal of this guy? For the love of cheese, explain to me what I am missing.\n\n_____\n\n> *Hello, users of CMV! This is a footnote from your moderators. We'd just like to remind you of a couple of things.

I can understand that abortion is a significant justification for evangelicals voting in pro-life candidates, but no reasonable person can deny the political expediency of Trump's new views on abortion. \n\nSo, if one is not in denial, the way Trump has made a living and how he lives his life shatter the foundations of christian principles. How can one be a devout evangelical christian that follows the teachings of Jesus Christ and not be hypocritical by voting for Trump? I am not saying they vote for Clinton, but on paper it seems she's ironically lived the more pious life.\n\n_____\n\n> *Hello, users of CMV! This is a footnote from your moderators.

            "selftext": "Since Spring 2015 when this election cycle began in earnest, we have been bombarded by news about the presidential candidates. Conservatives/Republicans claim that the media doesn't cover the newest Hilary Clinton corruption developments and that they deliver biased and exagerated narratives of Trump's past and present misdeeds, while liberals/Democrats claim that the Trump can get away from media criticism and is held to a lower standard than Clinton is, and that stories of Clinton's corruption are at best speculative and at worst lies to get page views. Both of these narratives cannot be true simultaneously.\n\nAccording to this septeber 2016 Gallup poll, 51% of Democrats and 14% of Republican contribute to a nationwide 31% fair amount or greater trust in the media, which is the lowest it has ever fallen for as long as the poll has been taken. Independent analyses of media bias tend to show that in general, most main stream sources are a little left of center, and that presidential election coverage has been both positive and negative depending on the salient issues of the week, with no actual bias detectable.\n\nWhen people complain about generalized news bias like \"the liberal media\" or \"conservative conspiracies popularised by the news\", they are complaining about a phenomenon that doesn't exist. News companies cater to different audiences along the political spectrum, but because there are so many negative stories about both candidates, it is wrong to say that in this election cycle the news is more or less biased than in the past.\n\nTo change my view, I want to see proof or reasoning that the bias people claim exists is different than the existence of factually correct reporting on news stories that are simply negative for our candidates.",

            "selftext": "From the experience of the last twenty years, I think a reasonable case can be made that ability to drive a narrative and name recognition is the primary driver, if not the only driver, of politicians' success. I think enlarging districts and the click-based (rather than subscription-based) nature of news on the internet has made this aspect many times worse, and has warped the US' ability to propose qualified candidates. Rather than reforming the news, likely a violation of the first amendment and I believe a futile fight against the natural progression of technology, and the current court's belief that election reform can only be carried out by a Constitutional majority, I think we should focus more upon producing qualified candidates in the first place.\r\rFurthermore, scientists' solutions to present problems are meaningless if a government does not have the capability and foresight to adopt new ideas that seem feasible. A scientist who wishes to improve the world, say for example a scientist who develops a food additive that reduces cows' production of methane, is directly reliant on a politician who has the free time and resources to drive narrative for them.\r\rI think the federal government should allocate financial resources to the development and sponsorship of schools of public policy in every state, a sort of decentralized system of the sort that turned China into the preeminent power in the world until Opium and guns led to its' downfall.\r\rI think, if properly decentralized, a system of schools of public policy that say, give massive election financing to top ten graduates (using matching funds or multipliers, maybe) would do a great deal to improve political discourse and robustness. Money is becoming a greater and greater driver of political success (as Trump and Hillary aptly illustrate - one has the trump brand, the other the Clinton brand), and if it is not feasible to take money out of politics because Roberts thinks money can't be excised from speech, why not sponsor qualified candidates, rather than letting candidates rise upon their own meager financial resources.\r\rHope to hear your thoughts.",

My fianc\u00e9e and I both work in comfortable & secure jobs with excellent health benefits, and our combined income plants squarely in the middle class.\n\n* I am a registered Republican who began supporting Gary Johnson's campaign the moment the GOP nomination was going to go to either Ted Cruz or Donald Trump.\n\n* I live in a deep blue state, and as such have the luxury of voting with my conscience. If I lived in a swing state or a toss-up state, I would close my eyes, plug my nose, bite the bullet, hold down the vomit, and vote for Clinton. \n\n* I truly believe that the GOP is about to cross the point of no return if Trump wins this election, a situation that will most likely result in my leaving the party forever.\n\n* I acknowledge that Trump will be an unmitigated disaster for this nation, the likes of which will make Bush II seem like an FDR/LBJ/Eisenhower/Reagan conglomeration of excellence.\n\nAll that being said, I feel like I could survive a four-year Trump presidency in relatively good shape. I absolutely think it'll take the country decades to undue the damage that even one Trump term will bring on, but from a purely selfish perspective I don't think on a micro scale I will see the real negative effects of his presidency. \n\nI'm trying to convince myself, with the polls tightening as hard as they have been, that a Trump presidency won't be Armageddon, and right now the selfish belief that **I** (as well as my fianc\u00e9e and out families) will be fine with it is what I'm grasping to right now.

The code is certainly proprietary anyways.\n\nRecently, some people have been criticizing the model for being too volatile. But I think that's a good thing for FiveThirtyEight and ESPN. It is effective at making them money.\n\nLet's say Clinton wins. If their chances for her are above 50%, then in the eyes of the public they still predicted the \"correct\" result. If their chances for her are above 40%, they could easily argue that she won the dice roll, and they wouldn't lose very much.\n\nLet's say Trump wins. FiveThirtyEight has consistently had the most optimistic chances for him. So they gain reputation here 100% of the time. Compare with PEC which gives Clinton a 99% chance. If Trump wins, Sam Wang and his grad students are gonna have to close shop from the reputation hit.\n\nSo regardless of whether or not the FiveThirtyEight model is good or not, the site stands to gain by having a more volatile model. It generates more stuff for their writers to write about, and drives more traffic. Nate Silver and ESPN are gonna make money off of that site no matter what happens.\n\n_____\n\n> *Hello, users of CMV! This is a footnote from your moderators.

His statement is this:\n\n> We (in the US) don't have high quality infrastructure and tuition-free college because we support you. We pay for your defense.\n\nComparing the statistics between Europe and the US:\n\n* From [here](http://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/statistics-explained/index.php/Government_expenditure_on_education):\n > In 2014, general government expenditure on 'education' in the EU-28 amounted to 4.9 % of GDP.\n\n In the same year the US spent [5.78% of GDP](http://www.usgovernmentspending.com/year_spending_2014USpn_14pc2n_20#usgs302) on education.\n\n* From [here](http://www.forbes.com/sites/paulroderickgregory/2013/04/01/infrastructure-gap-look-at-the-facts-we-spend-more-than-europe/#791dd10a137a):\n > According to OECD statistics, the United States spends 3.3 percent of its GDP (2006-2011) on infrastructure investment versus the European Union\u2019s 3.1 percent.\n\n* In addition, the [US GDP per capita is 1.5 times higher than that of the EU](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economy_of_the_European_Union), which means that the difference of spending per citizen on education and infrastructure between the EU and the US is even more extreme.\n\nThis makes the claim false, that the US cannot have a similar quality of infrastructure and price of higher education as the EU *because* it is spending so much on European defense. The US is already spending more on both of these issues than the EU, both in absolute and in relative terms.\n\nThe only actual threat that Europe could be defended against by the US is Russia. Russia spends [somewhere between $50bn and $70bn per year](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Military_budget_of_the_Russian_Federation) on the military depending on the ruble-dollar exchange rate. [The EU spent $194.7bn in 2014](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Military_of_the_European_Union), which is somewhere between 3 and 4 times that of Russia. That alone would suggest that it can defend itself against a Russian aggression. In addition, with France and Great Britain the EU has it's own nuclear force, which by itself can work as a deterrence against an attack. \n\nIn fact, taking the original argument into account, even if the US military spending were on the same level as that of the EU, it would still rally with its European allies against any Russian aggression, the same way European countries rallied to the side of the US when it invoked Article 5 after 9/11; which would then make it even more impossible for anyone to successfully attack the EU. That is the very point of a defensive alliance like NATO.\n\nYou can change my view for example by pointing out that my interpretation of the numbers is wrong, or that the EU in fact absolutely requires its ally US for defending itself against any real threat **and** that it requires the US to pay more than itself to do that.\n\n_____\n\n> *Hello, users of CMV!

            "selftext": "This topic is mostly spawned due to the conflict of Professor Jordan B. Peterson at the University of Toronto and his refusal to use pronouns he believed are made up and how he believes that a new addition to the Canadian charter would deal with such claims. The controversy section on his wikipedia page seems to be a good summary for any one who is not aware of this conflict.\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jordan_Peterson\n\nI agree with Peterson in that I don't feel that the right to be referred by your preferred pronoun trumps another person's right to refuse. My basic reason for this is that I simply find it a matter of respect on whether one person is referred to by their pronoun or not, and by how this tends to occur in other scenarios, the right of someone to insult or belittle someone trumps their right to not be insulted or belittled.\n\nI look at this simply, if someone refuses to call someone a doctor despite having earned the title, it would be rude, but it doesn't trump their right to ignore it. Same if someone insults someone by calling them an asshole or a bastard, this right trumps anyone's right to not be insulted. \n\nBy calling someone who identifies as a man a woman, you are simply disrespecting their chosen pronoun, it is as much an attack on their identity as calling them an asshole, it is not something more severe that requires stronger protections as pronouns are strictly related in how others refer to you. I do not believe that someone has the right to be referred as they please or have respect, as that impedes other's people's rights to choose whether to respect others. \n\n_____\n\n> *Hello, users of CMV!

Policy proposals are nothing more than campaign rhetoric designed to sound good and get votes, so I don't care about them either. \n\nHumor me and set those things aside for the moment and focus on Russia.\n\nRussia is the most powerful military power after us. They can tremendously hurt us...without even using nukes. Why is Hillary Clinton so anti-Russia?\n\nAccording to her, the various WikiLeaks revelations come from the \"highest levels of the Russian government, clearly, from Putin himself.\" Trump himself is a \"puppet\" for the Kremlin. Russian hackers will undermine the integrity of the election itself by hacking our voting systems. I'm not aware of any credible evidence of any of this. Please tell me if you know of any.\n\nShe's been pushing for a no-fly zone in Syria. She wants it despite knowing it would \"kill a lot of Syrians\" and that it would require direct confrontation with Russia ([see General Dunford's testimony](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fmE9Jj-rEVs), for instance). She's citing humanitarian reasons right now, as she did with Libya, but those turned out to be phony.\n\nNATO is deploying huge forces to eastern Europe along the Russian border. Britain sent a fleet of fighter jets to Romania and 800 troops supported by tanks & tactical drones to Estonia. America sent 330 troops to Norway, along with 900 more \"battle-ready\" troops & armor to Poland. Canada and Italy are sending 590 troops to Latvia. Germany is sending 600 troops to Lithuania, supported by additional forces from the Netherlands, Norway, Belgium, Croatia and Luxembourg. In sum, 10+ countries have deployed 4,000 troops across the Baltic states right at Russia's borders. Russia has every right to feel intimidated.\n\nNow I'm not saying Russia is innocent, because it isn't, but the US has recently invaded more countries than Russia has, most for shaky reasons. Syria invited Russia to help it fight ISIS. It didn't invite America there, but we're there anyway fighting on Al Qaeda's side to topple their government. WTF? \n\nIt seems like the whole world is gearing up for serious war for reasons I don't understand. \n\nWhy can't we work with Russia? Aren't we united against ISIS? Why are we promoting anti-Russia sentiment in America? Why are we mobilizing huge resources to counter Russian aggression? Where is this Russian aggression that threatens the west anyway?\n\nShouldn't the prospect of war with the second-largest military power (who'd likely be allied with the world's third-largest military power, China) be a bigger campaign issue than it is?",

I find it highly unethical (full disclosure I'm not voting for Trump and do not want to see him in office). Even if you could ensure the person you are trading votes with does what they say they will, which you cannot, I just see this as a total slap in the face of democracy. You are essentially taking the power from some states. If a state's natural voting outcome is to give its electoral college votes to Trump then that is what should happen. If this happens because third party candidates are popular in that state then so be it. If a candidate does not have enough popularity in that state to be elected outright, they should not be elected. I do not want this to turn into an argument on why the electoral college sucks so try to keep the focus on vote trading, thanks in advance for the conversation! \n\n_____\n\n> *Hello, users of CMV!

            "selftext": "Hi Reddit\n\nFirst let me skip the qualifications about how awful Trump is--I agree much of what he says is awful/untrue, but this is about something I think is overblown.\n\n[This video](https://youtu.be/ESH49gTcaAU) came up in my FB newsfeed and at about the 1:50 mark one person conveys disgust that Trump suggested pregnancy is an inconvenience to businesses. I know this person is not alone in the way they feel. But it seems like Trump is correct. [Here is the clip with him saying it](https://youtu.be/Q6qkJhbA7p0). It seems like one of those things we accept--like sleeping.\n\nI could get so much more done and see so many other things if I didn't have to sleep, but 1/3 of my life is dedicated to it. It is a major inconvenience (I realize others may take issue with this analogy--try to see it for what it is and not get lost in the weeds).\n\nHow can a person argue that pregnancy is anything but an inconvenience for a business? Even if someone points to human reproduction as necessary for a society to survive, so what? It being necessary has no bearing on whether or not it's inconvenient to a business--it's closer to the sleep analogy in that case.\n\nYou have an employee who will get paid without producing work (assuming the business offers maternity leave--a separate topic). They will then be distracted by obligations to the child--let's be honest, unless you never see your child, working 'round the clock is less likely (work-life balance, etc are all separate issues) and let's assume the person isn't a completely absent parent--most aren't.\n\nSo CMV: pregnancy is an inconvenience to a business, and there was nothing wrong with Donald pointing that out.\n\n_____\n\n> *Hello, users of CMV!

            "selftext": "They are hyperbolic, slightly racist, create an us vs them mentality, and prefer emotion to facts.\n\nSo let's start with the name (not an all lives matter thing I promise) which really sets the tone for the movement.  The name of a group is usually related to what you are advocating for.  Now, by naming yourself black lives matter, and advocating that you think people should act in a way that is consistent with black lives mattering, you are making a claim.  You are claiming, that a sizable minority, or even a majority, of white people do not think that black lives have any value, that they matter at all.  When they chant \"black lives matter\" they are telling us that because they want us to know that black lives matter.  If they thought that the people thought that black lives matter, there would be no point in chanting it at us.  \n\nIf people did not think black lives did not matter, it wouldn't be a crime or even frowned upon to murder a black person and then admit you did it.  While we have a long way to go when it comes to civil rights, it is beyond hyperbolic to claim any significant percentage of people do not think black lives have value.\n\nNow, I want to preface this next part by saying I respect the argument that you don't only have to focus on the biggest problems, smaller problems matter too.  Just because lung cancer kills more people than X, Y or Z cancer doesn't mean we shouldn't focus on X,Y, or Z as well.  \n\nThat being said, the police shooting issue needs to be put in perspective, both in terms of the size of the problem and why it has become their key issue.  In 2015, about 100 unarmed black people were killed by police.  If you are black and you follow the law, or even if you break the law, the odds of you getting shot by a police officer are infinitesimally small. \n\nIn that context, I think it's telling that the issue that gets the BLM movement so worked up is the issue they can blame on the outsider.  Now, I know poverty and problems in the black community are due to the legacy of, and to a lesser but still important extent, discrimination.  However, this is a concrete example of when they can blame \"the other\". They can blame the evil, largely white police, for their problems. When black people kill black people, it's hard to blame the other.  This is why police shootings are their issue even though it's about number 1,259 on the list of most important issues facing their community.\n\nIt's this fear of the other and blame outsiders for problems, legitimate or not, that drives the movement.  And as such, the movement tends to rely heavily on these emotional appeals as opposed to facts.  \n\nFor example, in a world where the police were not racist at all, and used force only where appropriate, black people would still be disproportionately more likely to be shot by police. \n\nA black Harvard economist recently released a study showing race is a non-factor in deciding when to use lethal force.  http://www.nytimes.com/2016/07/12/upshot/surprising-new-evidence-shows-bias-in-police-use-of-force-but-not-in-shootings.html  Yes black people are shot at higher rate than white people by police, but they also commit violent crimes at a higher rate. If a group commits more violent crimes, they are going to get shot by police more often.  \n\nAgain, the reason for the violent crime rate is because of past and current discrimination, but that has nothing to do with their claim.  They paint a narrative where police are just running around shooting black people because they don't give a shit about the value of black lives. \n\nIs police brutality an issue, yes.  But so are Trump's issues like illegal immigration, and voter fraud, and Clinton's campaign donations from wall street, and immigrants from the Middle East bringing extremism.  \n\nNow, what both Trump and BLM have done is they have taken these small-medium sized issues, but through hyperbole and creating an us vs them narrative made them into something far bigger as a scapegoat for other problems.\n\n> *Hello, users of CMV!

            "selftext": "I'm not a US citizen and thus can't vote in the upcoming election but if I could, the prospect of Trump becoming president terrifies me and I would rather vote for Public Enemy's hype man [Flavor Flav](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CPNK0VspQ0M) than vote for Trump. \n\nThis idea occurred to me when I met my first ever university educated Trump supporter. He raised several points that basically boiled down to:\n\n1. The political system is corrupt and is in need of reform\n2. The Clintons are even more corrupt\n3. Trump will act to reduce government\n4. Because Trump is self founded he is more immune to lobbying\n\nOf these four points I only disagree with the last two.\n\nMy response to the first two points is that the US electoral system is flawed, a [we vote for tyrants because otherwise the wrong tyrant will win](http://www.goodreads.com/quotes/162557-it-comes-from-a-very-ancient-democracy-you-see-you). But if your goal is to improve the system by voting for Trump is not the way to go about it. I hope that *after the election* the DNC is forced to reform for its actions in the primaries. The risk of Trump becoming president is simply too high to risk challenging the system now.\n\nI would have been a Sanders supporter but I would have happily support Romney or even Pailin if it came to that. I am even willing to accept it as a given that Clinton has illegally accepted funds and has acted criminally (with regards to emails or anything short of murder). I still would vote for the option of [\"random voter\"](http://jpupdates.com/2016/09/19/philosopher-sam-harris-fires-salvo-at-trump/) than Trump. This is what made me think of Flavor Flav.\n\nI belive that Flav would realise how out of his depth he was and the White House would effectively be run by either party's administration.  \n\nAs for Trump's policies, I see his policies to be demagoguery; I don't believe he'll stick to a single policy. Not the wall, not the undocumented immigrants. I believe that he would say that he'd turn in to a chicken if he thought he'd increase his chance of winning.\nEven if a handful of his policies might be appealing to me, I have to throw the baby out with the Trump bathwater. \n\nThe idea of Trump being preferable because he hasn't been \"bought\" by lobbyists or foreign interests also does not convince me. His refusal to hand over tax records and his business actions give me no confidence that Trump would be more likely to act in the best interest of the American people, his conscience or act in a way that doesn't serve his interests. \n\nThe reason why I am most concerned is that I believe that Trump is actually dangerous. Although the military administration have stated they would refuse an unjustified order to launch nuclear weapons, this is not something I think this is a game of chicken the world should be playing.\n\nPlease, help me change my view\n_____\n\n> *Hello, users of CMV!

            "selftext": "First off, I understand that the word \"fascist\" has been misused for decades by people as a sort of slang term for anyone they perceive to be an evil figure of authority. That is not what I am saying. This is 100% serious and Godwin's law does not apply.\n\nMy argument is that Donald Trump's entire campaign is based on fascist principles, thus making him by definition a fascist.\n\nBecause Fascism is by its very nature deceitful, it is hard for academics to agree on a rigid set of \"fascist\" principles. That being said, most historians are able to agree on certain fundamentals that fascist regimes have had in common.\n\n[This article](https://ratical.org/ratville/CAH/fasci14chars.html) from 2003 brings forth 14 key features that fascist movements have had in common. There are plenty of other resources that say basically the same thing, but I don't want to overcomplicate things, so I will base my argument off of these 14 points.\n\n1) Powerful and Continuing Nationalism\n\n   >\"Fascist regimes tend to make constant use of patriotic mottos, slogans, symbols, songs, and other    paraphernalia. Flags are seen everywhere, as are flag symbols on clothing and in public displays.\" \n  \nThis one is the most obvious, and doesn't really require a lot of explanation. Trump's campaign relies on a mythical view of America where everything is perfect and nobody was hurting for money. The trouble is, that was never the case. Trump has managed to stir up aggressive nationalists and sympathizers by doing what is essentially psychological racketeering. He's creating a problem that doesn't exist (America not being great), so that he can reap the benefits of people who are willing to buy in and let him fix it. This is the same strategy Mussolini, Franco, Hitler, Erdogan, etc. used.\n\n2) Disdain for the Recognition of Human Rights \n\n>Because of fear of enemies and the need for security, the people in fascist regimes are persuaded that human rights can be ignored in certain cases because of \"need.\" The people tend to look the other way or even approve of torture, summary executions, assassinations, long incarcerations of prisoners, etc. \n\nTrump has suggested \"bombing terrorist's families\" and torture. After [The Central Park Five](http://www.nytimes.com/2016/10/18/opinion/why-trump-doubled-down-on-the-central-park-five.html?_r=0) were acquitted of murder, Trump refused to pull back his statement that the men (who were exonerated by DNA evidence) should be executed. Trump has spent his entire campaign attempting to delegitimize the free press, and has successfully convinced a significant number of people that literally everything on the news is false, and that only he is telling them the truth. This was a tactic implemented by the Nazis in the 1930s, known as [L\u00fcgenpresse](http://time.com/4544562/donald-trump-supporters-lugenpresse/). I am not referring to this one incident as my evidence, just as background on what it means. Trump doesn't say that word, but he conveys the exact same message. Trump has shown a propensity to take legal action against anyone saying negative things about him, and has even said that he wants to be able to more easily sue news stations for (\"libel\")[http://www.npr.org/2016/03/24/471762310/donald-trump-wants-to-open-up-libel-laws-so-he-can-sue-news-outlets]. This is concerning not because he doesn't want people telling lies about him, he doesn't want anyone saying *anything* negative about him at all.\n\n3) Identification of Enemies/Scapegoats as a Unifying Cause \n\n>The people are rallied into a unifying patriotic frenzy over the need to eliminate a perceived common threat or foe: racial , ethnic or religious minorities; liberals; communists; socialists, terrorists, etc. \n\nThis one is obvious. The Hispanics are taking our jobs, black people are responsible for all the horrible crime and all they do is take from hardworking americans, the muslim refugees are sneaking into our country to kill us, Obama is a secret muslim terrorist, Hillary Clinton is a baby eating satan worshiper. The point is that the fascist hears these fears from a common person who is rightfully pissed off about not getting a fair shake, and plays on that by directing their attention away from the real root of their problems to meet their own personal goals. There is no stronger motivation than hatred. The people lose sight of what's really wrong and start to lash out.\n\n4) Supremacy of the Military \n\n>Even when there are widespread domestic problems, the military is given a disproportionate amount of government funding, and the domestic agenda is neglected. Soldiers and military service are glamorized. \n\nDonald Trump wants to beef up military spending, bomb whoever, and encourages the deification of the military into a mythical organization of heroes with no care for the actual character of any individual military member.\n\n5) Rampant Sexism \n\n>The governments of fascist nations tend to be almost exclusively male-dominated. Under fascist regimes, traditional gender roles are made more rigid. Opposition to abortion is high, as is homophobia and anti-gay legislation and national policy. \n\nWe've all heard Trump's misogyny a million times on the news, so I won't bother repeating it. But when we have a [person running for a public office](http://www.mysanantonio.com/news/local/article/Texas-Ag-Commissioner-Sid-Miller-calls-Hillary-10445369.php) who feels entitled to publicly call a political opponent a \"Cunt\", it shows Trump's ability to normalize something that is absolutely not normal, like a complete lack of respect for women.\n\n6) Controlled Mass Media \n\n>Sometimes to media is directly controlled by the government, but in other cases, the media is indirectly controlled by government regulation, or sympathetic media spokespeople and executives. Censorship, especially in war time, is very common. \n\nYou can make the argument that this is already done by the Democrats but just because you have a cough doesn't mean you have lung cancer. It's hard not to see a connection between attacking *all* news as being biased and untrustworthy and the desire for an \"unbiased\" news source. What is an \"unbiased\" news source anyway? If you want all your \"unbiased\" information to come from one place instead of having to put the pieces together yourself, you want controlled mass media.\n\n7)Obsession with National Security \n\n>Fear is used as a motivational tool by the government over the masses. \n\nKind of goes along with 1 and 3. You are under attack, and I am here to protect you.\n\n8) Religion and Government are Intertwined \n\n>Governments in fascist nations tend to use the most common religion in the nation as a tool to manipulate public opinion. Religious rhetoric and terminology is common from government leaders, even when the major tenets of the religion are diametrically opposed to the government's policies or actions. \n\nLike Mussolini, Trump has no use for religion other than as a political tool. It's clear he does not, and may have never actually read the bible. He has simply aligned his official policies with that of the Evangelical religious establishment. Mussolini did the same thing with [Catholic Church](http://www.historylearningsite.co.uk/modern-world-history-1918-to-1980/italy-1900-to-1939/mussolini-and-the-roman-catholic-church/). \n\n9) Corporate Power is Protected \n\n>The industrial and business aristocracy of a fascist nation often are the ones who put the government leaders into power, creating a mutually beneficial business/government relationship and power elite. \n\nDonald's tax plan would be a love letter to large corporations who have to burn through a lot of resources to avoid taxation.\n\n10) Labor Power is Suppressed \n\n>Because the organizing power of labor is the only real threat to a fascist government, labor unions are either eliminated entirely, or are severely suppressed. \n\nPeople like Donald Trump don't have to worry about a revolt from the working class finding out who has *really* been ripping them off when they can so artfully pit white working class folks against working class minorities.\n\n11) Disdain for Intellectuals and the Arts \n\n>Fascist nations tend to promote and tolerate open hostility to higher education, and academia. It is not uncommon for professors and other academics to be censored or even arrested. Free expression in the arts is openly attacked, and governments often refuse to fund the arts. \n\nThere is a lot of hate that gets thrown around by the Trump demographic about \"Liberal Universities\" and how they're just brainwashing people. It doesn't matter that outside of the financial burden, education as a whole tangibly improves your living circumstances. Higher education helps develop stronger critical thinking skills, which are crucial in sifting through alarmist rhetoric to get to the facts. We can see [here](http://www.wsj.com/articles/hillary-clinton-leads-donald-trump-by-4-points-in-latest-poll-1478440818) that in the latest Wall Street Journal/ABC poll, Donald Trump is going to be the first republican nominee to lose the vote of college educated white people since polling records began being tracked in the 1950s. There is clearly something about what Trump is selling that simply does not mesh with the views of educated people, regardless of their traditional political values. The platform is based around things that are objectively false. The kicker is that Trump surrogates like [Newt Gingrich](http://www.forbes.com/sites/startswithabang/2016/08/05/newt-gingrich-exemplifies-just-how-unscientific-america-is/#f94fb3928328) and Rudy Giuliani consistently appear in media and intentionally muddy the waters with a \"feelings over facts\" strategy. \n\n12) Obsession with Crime and Punishment \n\n>Under fascist regimes, the police are given almost limitless power to enforce laws. The people are often willing to overlook police abuses and even forego civil liberties in the name of patriotism. There is often a national police force with virtually unlimited power in fascist nations. \n\nFascist leaders always have the support of a partisan law enforcement service. What does it say when [84%](http://www.policemag.com/channel/patrol/articles/2016/09/the-2016-police-presidential-poll.aspx) of police (an occupation that is big on unions and is considered pretty Democratic) go for the guy that openly talks about how [crime would go away if police were just \"tougher\"] (http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/ct-trump-chicago-police-crime-met-20160823-story.html)? He says he wants to [implement stop and frisk nation wide](http://abcnews.go.com/Politics/donald-trump-calls-nationwide-stop-frisk-policy/story?id=42261880), which would only put cops in more danger, and doesn't seem to care that it was deemed [unconstitutional](http://www.nytimes.com/2013/08/13/nyregion/stop-and-frisk-practice-violated-rights-judge-rules.html) several years ago.\n\n13) Rampant Cronyism and Corruption \n\n>Fascist regimes almost always are governed by groups of friends and associates who appoint each other to government positions and use governmental power and authority to protect their friends from accountability. It is not uncommon in fascist regimes for national resources and even treasures to be appropriated or even outright stolen by government leaders. \n\nWhat is Donald even doing in this race other than trying to serve the interests of his family? What was Donald doing [giving a gift](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/trump-denies-he-talked-with-florida-attorney-general-about-donation/2016/09/05/e15d62e0-73b8-11e6-8149-b8d05321db62_story.html) to an incumbent state at the same time she dropped an investigation into his Trump Foundation?\n\n14) Fraudulent Elections \n\n>Sometimes elections in fascist nations are a complete sham. Other times elections are manipulated by smear campaigns against or even assassination of opposition candidates, use of legislation to control voting numbers or political district boundaries, and manipulation of the media. Fascist nations also typically use their judiciaries to manipulate or control elections.\n\nFascism has varied from leader to leader. Donald Trump can't rig the United States election. It is not logistically possible to rig our election due to its decentralized nature. What he can do though, is attempt to delegitimize the democracy we are founded on in order to create confusion and ultimately destabilize the structure of our election system.\n\nBonus Point/Conclusion.\n\nTrump is fiercely anti-globalist. He has repeatedly called to withdraw from our position as a worldwide economic and social leader, specifically in relation to NAFTA and NATO. Trade is bad because the Chinese are preying on us because we're weak, he says. We need to bring manufacturing jobs back, he says, with no mention that basic economic theory teaches that an increase in the cost of labor results in an increase in the price of goods. If there is one thing that fascism is *really* about, it's the belief that the nation is so strong that it doesn't need to engage anyone on the outside.\n\nIn order to change my view, you would have to convince me that  \n\nA) Donald Trump is right, and Hillary Clinton and her cronies have truly been defrauding the United States government\n\nor \n\nB) There are circumstances in which the political views that he espouses have an application outside of an authoritarian pseudo-democracy.\n\nor \n\nC) Something I am missing entirely about this whole sh*t show (Which is possible) I like to hear different perspectives.",

            "selftext": "I did a quick search on the Republican party in this subreddit and found a lot of similar but not exactly the same subjects, so I hope this post is different enough to be in line with the subs guidelines.\n\nMy basic premisse is that the Republican party will fail, at least until the next election cycle, to learn the lessons it needs to learn to continue to be viable as a presidential party (I just realised that I am basicaly assuming a Clinton win here). They do not believe that there is anything wrong with their positions, they believe they have an 'optics' problem. Furthermore, especially after this election, the republican base isn't going away, and the party itself might be too tainted to be acceptable to a significant number of democrats. And finally, the republican party and media will continue to function under similar incentive structures. All these factors prevent substantive change on the short to mid term (1-2 elections at least). \n\nLet's start of by taking a quick look at the 2012 autopsy report. While I believe that report came to some accurate conclusions, the language suggests they fail to realise the extent to which they need to change their positions. Take for example the oft quoted line: \n\n\"If Hispanic Americans **perceive** that a GOP nominee or candidate does not want them in the United States (i.e. self-deportation), they will not pay attention to our next sentence.\" (emphasis mine, [source](http://talkingpointsmemo.com/dc/6-big-takeaways-from-the-rnc-s-incredible-2012-autopsy))\n\nThe key word being *perceive*, not that the Republican party has an actual and current history of disenfranchisment, xenophobia, and racism, but that it is *perceived* that way. Or take the following line:\n\n\"Already, there is a generational difference within the conservative movement about issues involving the treatment and the rights of gays -- and for many younger voters, these issues are a gateway into whether the Party is a place they want to be,\"\n\nOnce again, I don't see an acceptance of gay people, but more of a 'lets not talk about this anymore', we will still accept homophobes into the core of our party. In short, they seem to believe that they have a perception problem, and thus fail to acknowledge the bigotry that is quite central in their party. This bigotry has become abundantely obvious through this election cycle. Trump voters a.k.a. the Republican base, don't care about conservative issues, as evidenced by the unwavering support of the Republican base for Donald Trump. \n\nEven someone like Glenn Beck who's doing his best right now to pivot to the center, talks about Michelle's speeches as effective, not because republicans are sexist, but because Trump makes it *seem* like they are what Democrats have been saying they are: sexist and racist. Again showing a fundamental lack of understanding of the Republican base.\n\nNow, one might counter this line of arguing by pointing to candidates like Rubio and Jeb(!) as an attempt to broaden the base to include Hispanic voters. But, as we all know, these efforts failed miserably. Which brings me to my second point: the Republican base won't go away, especially now. They are more then before, distrustful of the Republican establishment. Which is why Trump won, and why any future republican will still have to appeal to the far-right republican base. This prevents any substantive enlargements of potential republican voters. So even if Republicans wanted to, they couldn't change significantly without also losing the base. And I suspect a lot of Democrats won't be voting for Republicans in a while.\n\nFinally, some words on the incentive structures within the Republican party and media. There is a lot of big donor money propping up conservative hosts from Koch Brothers-types looking to push anti-government and regulation sentiment. Same goes for Republican candidates like Scott Walker. Moneyed interests within the party will still be pushing for dangerous and outright stupid fiscal policies and endless tax cuts long after Trump is gone. This makes it even harder to pivot towards policies that are popular amongst the general public. \n\nA fundamental misunderstanding of the bigotry within the republican party, combined with an increasingly extreme Republican base, and incentive structures that prevent responsible policies taken together make significant change within the Republican party highly unlikely. \n\nI do think there is an awareness that something must change amongst a lot of Republicans, I just have little confidence they will truly be able to do so on the short term and would like to hear some good reasons to think otherwise. ~~If~~ when Donald Trump loses, the Republicans will come back and pretend as if Trump never happened. There are already some early indications of this, like the rumblings about not electing a new supreme court judge from the likes of McCain and talks of Clinton indictments the moment she gets in office. Instead of changing, this whole cycle seems to have been about doubling down.\n\nEdit1: Some language corrections\nEdit2: more of the same\n\n> *Hello, users of CMV!

She jumped on that train pretty late, even for a Democrat. She was firmly against gay marriage, and her recent emails suggest she may still be.\n\nThe War on Iraq. Sure, many politicians got this wrong. But Clinton was, IIRC, pretty vocal on this. Only 20 Democrats in the end did vote against the War on Iraq. Whilst clearly a huge mistake in hindsight, we can perhaps forgive this one.\n\nLibya - She has to take part-responsibility for this. We've all the seen the \"we came, we saw, he died\" video. She was the aggressor, and she does need to take responsibility for the lack of forward planning, with, of course, Obama.\n\nHer defense of Wall Street - It is only now, in the last few years, that it has become mainstream to criticise Wall Street. People know that it was Wall Street responsible for 2008 now. Yet, in 2008, Clinton was still blaming home owners and refused to portion any blame on Wall Street.\n\nHonduras - She literally backed a fascist regime.\n\nSupported the death squads in Nicaragua in the 80s\n\nBefore the Iraq Nuclear Deal, she was always very aggressive towards Iran.\n\nShe supported the continued embargo on Cuba.\n\nShe supported No Child Left Behind.\n\nIt is on record she was one telling Bill to bomb Bosnia. Resulted in civilian deaths.\n\nSupported the PATRIOT act twice.\n\nVoted for the 2001 Bankruptcy Legislation which would have made it harder for struggling Americans to declare bankruptcy, after expressing her opposition to the bill when she was First Lady.\n\nAnd then, of course, is the controversies. The obvious ties to Wall Street. The emails. The tactics used against Sanders, and the obvious fact she was colluding with the DNC to get the nomination. \n\nAll this leaves me wondering... when on earth was she correct and on the right side of history?\n\n> *Hello, users of CMV!

            "selftext": "I think my post is pretty self-explanatory. I am just ridiculously pessimistic about the state of the US Gov't with this current election, and have serious doubts about my vote making any difference in the election. I believe maybe it will make a local difference, but doubt it affects anything in my state and especially, especially at a national level. I would not be surprised at all if it was all just a sham, and that the most powerful entity behind the scenes is the one that gets the presidency. The electoral college is equally suspicious to me; why do we even need it? So many questions. Why can't we have NO parties, just individuals, with a popular vote, standardized voting across the country (e.g. mail-in ballots everywhere, or in-person voting everywhere, etc), and transparency about it all? \n\nEDIT: For clarity, my question isn't asking \"Why don't I get 100% of the choice?!?\" or even 0.000000000000001% of it.\nMy question is ultimately trying to ask \"What proof do we have that a vote makes even the SLIGHTEST impact at all, and that it's not all just a sham to satiate us while the powers behind the scenes are the ones who actually decide the outcome?\"\nI would be satisfied if I honestly had assurance beyond a reasonable doubt that my vote makes even a 0.000000000000000001% difference, but I'm not convinced that the actual number isn't simply 0.000000000000000000%.\n\nEDIT 2: Quite a few people are misunderstanding my question so...A METAPHOR to help explain--\nLet's say there is an extended family get-together of 100 people, and grandma is collecting the votes for all to go to either Burger King or McDonald's...but grandma has secretly decided that the family is going to McDonald's regardless of any and all votes. She goes around to all the family members individually and asks for their vote to give them an illusion of say in the matter, but secretly she really likes McDonald's parfaits and she decided she WILL have one today. To her it doesn't matter if 80+ people vote for Burger King; they're still going to McD's. She collects each vote individually and tells everyone that there were more votes for McD's regardless of the actual count; she knows that the family is large enough and everyone is generally busy enough that no one will actually be able to or at least take the time to prove which vote was actually the winner, and the family members are all generally happy enough not to riot because they at least feel they were \"heard\". \n\nAdditionally, there are other individuals involved in the voting process who pretend to act as representatives for tallying and stating the common popular vote (metaphor for the electoral college), but many of them really love McDonald's parfaits as well and secretly agreed with grandma earlier to vote for McDonald's too, further complicating the process and obscuring what could otherwise be a transparent view of the real popular vote. Even the other \"special\" individuals here who didn't want McDonald's won't rat grandma out, because they love having more say than that of the common family member, and they know that on later votes they may get to have their way. The ultimate outcome is that all the other family members all think they had a say in the matter, but really they all wasted their time voting and were never \"heard\" at all.\n\nEDIT3: More comments here than I can reply to, but just wanted to write in to say y'all convinced me to be significantly less-pessimistic about this election and got me out to vote.

If anyone can point me to a candidate like that, I would appreciate it, as I'd prefer to actually be able to vote this year.\n\nI would hope that there is a candidate who's policy is explicitly \"I follow economic consensus where and when it exist\". Same thing with science policy. But if these candidates exist, I sure can't find them anywhere, so again, help is greatly appreciated.

            "selftext": "Disclosure of biases.  I'm approaching this from an American perspective and I've studied a fair amount of economics, having taken both microeconomics and macroeconomics during my time as an undergraduate.\n\nFrom what I gather, there aren't really any serious economic arguments in favor of protectionism.  It's generally understood that protective trade policies might benefit some industry but at the expense of the economy as a whole.  In other words, a rational strategy for a nation seeking to maximize its GDP is to freely trade with anyone, regardless of whether they are placing tariffs on your exports or not.\n\nNevertheless there are people who agree and still support protective tariffs out of compassion for American workers.  I can understand the sympathy people feel toward these workers and to an extent I feel sympathetic myself.  One moment you had income, a livelihood and a sense of purpose and the next day you have none of those. And in many cases you get to watch all the prosperity from your town disappear.\n\nHowever, this perspective proposes limiting the prosperity of everyone else in order to save an industry that doesn't actually provide value.  I accept that GDP isn't everything and I hold it as a public good that my countrymen are happy.  So why not subsidize the re-education of these workers instead?  The alternative is to force Americans to overpay which places a terrible friction on economic activity.  \n\nI understand tariffs are not significantly used on imports into America.  This post is mostly a rejoinder to the protectionist rhetoric from Trump during this election cycle.  If you are looking for more protectionism, be careful what you're asking for.\n\n_____\n\n> *Hello, users of CMV! This is a footnote from your moderators.

I've never seen that before, EVER outside of a few guys like:\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vermin_Supreme\n\n...and such.\n\n/r/The_Donald was needed this year, and the Hillary supporters needed to realize the flaws on their side too.  Had they done so with 1/10th of the chaotic humor /r/The_Donald put into it, all of Reddit would have been better off.\n\nInstead we had \"Correct The Record\" and /r/politics going just as partisan as /r/The_Donald ever was...screw that.\n_____\n\n> *Hello, users of CMV!
